Answer: A
Explanation: HTTPS is a protocol for secure communication over a computer network. It is widely used on the Internet. HTTPS consists of communication over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) within a connection encrypted by Transport Layer Security or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer. The main motivation for HTTPS is authentication of the visited website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks. The bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server protects against eavesdropping and tampering of the communication. In practice, this provides a reasonable degree of security in ensuring that websites are actually who they claim to be.

Explanation: The WCSS (Web Content Security System) is a set of standards and specifications for mobile web development. It provides a framework for creating content that can be accessed by multiple devices, regardless of their screen size or resolution.
The WCSS is designed to improve the user experience by ensuring that content is displayed correctly on any device. It does this by defining a set of rules that developers must follow when creating content. These rules include:
1. Using relative units for measurements, such as percentages or ems, instead of absolute units like pixels.
2. Using media queries to adjust the layout and styling of content based on the device’s screen size.
3. Using responsive images to ensure that images are displayed correctly on different devices.
4. Using semantic HTML to improve accessibility and search engine optimization.
By following these rules, developers can create content that looks great on any device, regardless of its screen size or resolution. This helps to ensure that users have a consistent experience when accessing the same content on different devices.

Answer: C
Explanation: The DNS naming system is a system that allows you to use names to identify computers and other devices on the Internet.
The DNS naming system uses a hierarchy of names. The top level of the hierarchy is the top-level domain. Examples of top-level domains include.com,.net, and.edu.
The top-level domain is followed by one or more subdomains. The part of the name after the last subdomain is the hostname.
The DNS naming system also allows you to use a domain name that does not end with a top-level domain. These domain names are called absolute domain names. Absolute domain names end with a period. The period indicates that the name is full and exact.
For example, the domain name "www.example.com." is an absolute domain name. The domain name "www.example.com" is not an absolute domain name because it does not end with a period.
The domain name "www.example.com." is an absolute domain name because it ends with a period.

Explanation: XHTML Mobile Profile (XHTML MP) is a restricted version of XHTML that is optimized for use on mobile devices. XHTML MP is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict, but it is limited to a subset of XHTML elements and attributes.
The <form> element is used to create a form in XHTML MP. The <form> element has two required attributes: action and method. The action attribute specifies the URL of the server-side script that will process the form data, and the method attribute specifies the HTTP method that will be used to send the form data to the server.
The <form> element can also contain other XHTML elements, such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select>. These elements are used to create the form fields, such as text boxes, drop-down lists, and radio buttons.
The following is an example of a form in XHTML MP:
<form action="http://www.example.com/process_form.php" method="post">
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username">
<label for="password">Password:</label>
<input type="password" id="password" name="password">
<input type="submit" value="Log in">
In this example, the form has two text boxes for the username and password, and a submit button. When the user clicks the submit button, the form data will be sent to the server-side script at http://www.example.com/process_form.php using the POST method.

Explanation: A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that is used to divide an IP address into a network address and a host address. The subnet mask is a series of 1s followed by a series of 0s. The number of 1s represents the number of bits used for the network address. The remaining bits are used for the host address. The AND operation is used to separate the network address and the host address. The AND operation is performed on each bit of the IP address and the subnet mask. If the corresponding bit of the subnet mask is a 1, then the result of the AND operation is 1. If the corresponding bit of the subnet mask is a 0, then the result of the AND operation is 0. The AND operation results in the network address.

What is an Autonomous System (AS) in the context of Internet Service Providers (ISPs)?
An Autonomous System (AS) in the context of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) refers to a group of routers under a single administrative control. It is a collection of IP networks that is managed by a single administrative entity, such as an ISP. Each AS has its own routing policy and can communicate with other ASs through border routers. The AS number (ASN) is a unique identifier assigned to each AS, which is used for routing purposes. ASNs are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and are typically represented as a 16-bit number. ASs are an important part of the Internet infrastructure, as they allow for efficient routing of packets between different networks and ISPs.

An Autonomous System (AS) is a collection of routers under a single administrative control. It is a network of networks that is managed by a single entity, such as an Internet Service Provider (ISP). ASs are used to route traffic between different networks and to ensure that the traffic is delivered to the correct destination.
ASs are identified by a unique number, known as the AS number (ASN). The ASN is assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and is used to identify the network. ASNs are typically represented as a 16-bit number, although some ASNs may be longer.
ASs are used to provide a hierarchical structure for the Internet. Each AS is responsible for routing traffic within its own network, and for routing traffic between other ASs. This allows for efficient routing of traffic between different networks, and ensures that the traffic is delivered to the correct destination.
ASs are also used to provide security for the Internet. Each AS is responsible for ensuring that the traffic it receives is legitimate, and for preventing unauthorized access to the network. This helps to protect the network from malicious attacks, and ensures that the traffic is delivered to the correct destination.

Explanation: The most common use of the concept of bridging is in wired Ethernet networks. Wired Ethernet networks use hubs to connect devices together. A hub is a device that connects several Ethernet cables together. Each Ethernet cable connects to a different computer or device. When a computer sends data, the hub forwards the data to all the other Ethernet cables connected to it. This way, all the computers connected to the hub can receive the data.

The answer is C. The question is poorly worded, and the answer is misleading. I think the question is trying to say "It cannot guarantee message integrity for long messages".
To elaborate, it's easy to encrypt and decrypt large messages using public key cryptography. It's not vulnerable to brute force attacks. It's just that you need a way to verify that the message wasn't tampered with. If you can't do that, then you can't be sure that the message is what the sender intended to send. This is what the question is trying to get at.
$\begingroup$ So what's the difference between integrity and authenticity? $\endgroup$ – user10001 Jul 11 '16 at 15:44
$\begingroup$ @user10001: "integrity" is a property of a message, and it means that the message has not been tampered with. "authenticity" is a property of the sender, and it means that the message is from the person that you think it is from. $\endgroup$ – poncho Jul 11 '16 at 15:46
$\begingroup$ @user10001: the difference is that authenticity is a property of the sender, and integrity is a property of the message. $\endgroup$ – mikeazo Jul 11 '16 at 15:47
