A VPN is a virtual private network that creates a secure network connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. One type of VPN is the split tunnel VPN, which is a VPN that allows some traffic to remain on the local network, while other traffic is sent over the VPN.

Prompt 1702:
Correct answer:
B) 224.0.0.1
Explanation:
In the context of Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP), we need to identify the multicast address used by routers in the same HSRP group to send out HSRP packets.

Prompt 1703:
Correct answer:
B) To indicate that an MS has been alerted and is not yet responding during call pages.
Explanation:
This question is asking about the specific role of a supervisory audio tone (SAT) signal in the Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS) system. SAT signals are used in AMPS to convey certain information between the Mobile Station (MS) and the Base Station (BS).

Prompt 1704:
Correct answer:
D) To set up and tear down connections across the network
Explanation:
Rephrase and expand the question for better understanding: What role does signaling play in a circuit-switched network? Signaling in a circuit-switched network is crucial for establishing and terminating connections.

Prompt 1705:
Correct answer:
C) All layer 2, 3, and 4 fields shown in Figure 4.29 except the IP Protocol field
Explanation:
This question seeks to identify the packet header fields that can be modified using the Modify-field action in OpenFlow networking.

Prompt 1706:
Correct answer:
A) It provides the probability that the received power is below a certain threshold.
Explanation:
In the context of log-normal shadowing, the Q function is applied to the Gaussian density function to determine the probability that the received power is below a certain threshold.

Prompt 1707:
Correct answer:
C) Moving a datagram from one node to an adjacent node over a single communication link
Explanation:
This question is asking for the specific role that a link-layer protocol plays within a communication network. In essence, a link-layer protocol is responsible for the movement of datagrams from one node to an adjacent node over a single communication link.

Prompt 1708:
Correct answer:
D) It identifies the A2oMPLS connection carried
Explanation:
This question is about understanding the role of the Sequence Number (S No) field in the A2oMPLS header.

Prompt 1709:
Correct answer:
D) The computation required for encryption and decryption is extensive
Explanation:
This question is asking for the reason why public key cryptography is not considered efficient for long messages in the context of secure e-mail.

Prompt 1710:
Correct answer:
C) The new application will consume R/2 of the bandwidth.
Explanation:
This question asks about the behavior of a new application that uses multiple parallel TCP connections in a congested network link. The TCP congestion control algorithm is designed to manage bandwidth fairly among multiple applications sharing a network link.

Prompt 1711:
Correct answer:
D) UDP is considered fast and efficient as compared to TCP.
Explanation:
Let's rephrase the question for clarity: What is the fundamental difference between UDP and TCP in terms of their efficiency and speed?

Prompt 1712:
Correct answer:
C) By marking packets based on their importance at the point of ingress.
Explanation:
Rephrase and expand the question for better understanding: What is the most effective way to classify traffic in a Quality of Service (QoS) strategy? In a QoS strategy, traffic classification is done by marking packets based on their importance at the point of ingress into the network.

Prompt 1713:
Correct answer:
C) To distinguish between the host and network portions of an IP address.
Explanation:
Let's clarify the question: What is the primary function of a subnet mask in IP networking? A subnet mask is a crucial element in IP networking that plays a specific role in the addressing and routing of data packets.

Prompt 1714:
Correct answer:
B) Piggybacking is with the authorized person's awareness, while tailgating is without their consent or realization.
Explanation:
This question is about understanding the difference between piggybacking and tailgating in the context of physical security breaches.

Prompt 1715:
Correct answer:
A) The PVC is configured and active.
Explanation:
The question is asking about the meaning of a specific status code for a Frame Relay PVC as reported by the Frame Relay switch. Understanding the status codes for Frame Relay PVCs is crucial for troubleshooting and managing Frame Relay networks.

Prompt 1716:
Correct answer:
D) QAM
Explanation:
This question asks about the modulation technique used by the IEEE 802.11a OFDM standard at a common data rate of 18 Mbps.

Prompt 1717:
Correct answer:
B) TCP
Explanation:
Let's rephrase and expand the question for better understanding: Which transport-layer protocol is designed to provide reliable and ordered data delivery, as well as maintaining a connection between communicating applications?
