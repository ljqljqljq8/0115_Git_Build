A) Provides higher flexibility and better utilization of bandwidth.
Explanation: A hybrid TDM/FDM system is a combination of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) techniques. In this system, a 1 GHz frequency band is divided into multiple channels, and TDM is used within each channel. This approach provides higher flexibility and better utilization of bandwidth compared to a single TDM system.
In a single TDM system, all the data is transmitted in a single time slot, which can lead to inefficient utilization of bandwidth if the data rates are not well matched. On the other hand, in a hybrid TDM/FDM system, each channel has its own time slot, allowing for better synchronization and efficient utilization of bandwidth. Additionally, the use of FDM allows for multiple channels to be transmitted simultaneously, further increasing the flexibility and bandwidth utilization of the system.
Therefore, the correct answer is option A: Provides higher flexibility and better utilization of bandwidth.

E) POP3 is a more reliable protocol than IMAP, making it better suited for mission-critical applications.

Answer: B
Explanation: POP3 is a protocol used for retrieving emails from a server. It is a simple and reliable protocol that has been around for many years. One of the main advantages of POP3 is that it allows users to download emails from the server to their local computer, which means they can access their emails even when they are not connected to the internet. This is useful for users who want to be able to read their emails when they are offline or when they are traveling and don't have access to the internet. Another advantage of POP3 is that it reduces the load on the server by downloading emails to the user's local computer, which means that the server doesn't have to store all of the emails for an extended period of time. This can help to reduce the amount of storage space required on the server, which can be especially important for organizations that have a large number of users and a lot of email traffic. In summary, POP3 is a protocol that is well-suited for organizations that want to minimize the storage requirements on their email servers and allow their users to access their emails even when they are not connected to the internet.

Explanation: Web caching is the storage of frequently accessed web objects in a local cache on the client's computer or on a proxy server. A cache is a temporary storage area for frequently accessed information. When a user requests a web object, the local cache checks to see if the object is already stored in the cache. If so, the object is retrieved from the cache instead of being retrieved from the Internet, which reduces the delay in receiving the object.

Explanation: Traffic shaping is a technique used in packet-switched networks to regulate the flow of data packets to prevent congestion and ensure smooth traffic. By controlling the rate at which packets are transmitted, traffic shaping helps to maintain a consistent network performance and minimize delays. It works by monitoring the network traffic and adjusting the packet transmission rate to match the available bandwidth. This prevents packets from being sent too quickly, which can lead to network congestion and packet loss. Traffic shaping also helps to prioritize different types of traffic, such as voice or video, to ensure that they receive the necessary bandwidth.

Answer: A
Explanation: The original IP header is NOT encrypted.
prompt 87:
Answer: C
Explanation: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) is a protocol that enables the secure exchange of information between two parties, such as a client and a server. IKE is used to negotiate the establishment of a secure channel between the two parties, which can be used for authentication and encryption of data. The protocol is responsible for guaranteeing the security of data during transmission by encrypting packets between network devices, commonly used in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). IKE uses a combination of encryption algorithms and digital certificates to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged between the two parties. The protocol is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing it to be used in a variety of network environments. IKE is an important component of the IPsec protocol suite, which provides security services for IP-based networks.

Explanation: Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that uses a trusted third party, called a key distribution center (KDC), to distribute session keys to authenticated users. These session keys are used for the encryption and decryption of communications between the user and the server. The KDC acts as a trusted third party, verifying the user's credentials and distributing the session keys, which eliminates the need for end-to-end encryption and reduces the complexity of managing cryptographic keys. This centralized management of keys enhances security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to network resources.
prompt 89:

Explanation: A digital signature is a cryptographic method that can be used to authenticate the identity of the sender of a message or the signer of a document, and to ensure that the original content of the message or document that has been sent is unchanged. Digital signatures are similar to traditional handwritten signatures, but provide much greater security. A digital signature is created using a private key that only the sender possesses. The sender applies a cryptographic hash function to the document, encrypts the hash using the private key, and then appends the encrypted hash to the document. The receiver applies the same hash function to the received document, decrypts the appended hash with the sender's public key, and compares the decrypted hash with the newly calculated hash. If the hashes match, the document is authentic and has not been tampered with. In a public key infrastructure, the certification authority (CA) is responsible for issuing digital certificates. A certificate is a digitally signed statement that binds an entity's identity to a public key. The certificate includes the entity's name, a serial number, the CA's name, the entity's public key, the CA's digital signature, the certificate's validity period, and other information. The CA ensures that a digital signature is both valid and trustworthy by maintaining a list of revoked certificates and ensuring the certificate used is not on that list before validation.

Explanation: Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a powerful technology that enhances audio signal clarity in noise-cancelling headphones by identifying and negating ambient noise patterns from the audio signal in real-time. This process involves using advanced algorithms to analyze the audio signal and detect any unwanted noise components. Once these noise components are identified, the DSP algorithm can then generate an inverse signal that effectively cancels out the noise, resulting in a clearer and more immersive audio experience. This is achieved by applying a series of mathematical operations to the audio signal, such as filtering and equalization, which help to remove or attenuate the noise components without affecting the desired audio content. The result is a more accurate and natural sound reproduction, allowing users to enjoy their music or audio content without being distracted by background noise. Additionally, DSP algorithms can adapt to changing noise environments, making noise-cancelling headphones more effective in a variety of settings. Overall, DSP technology plays a crucial role in enhancing audio signal clarity in noise-cancelling headphones, providing users with a more enjoyable and immersive listening experience.

Answer: B
Explanation: A maximum power point tracker (MPPT) is a critical component in modern photovoltaic (solar) systems. It is designed to continuously adjust the electrical load to ensure that solar panels operate at their optimal efficiency, maximizing energy output regardless of varying sunlight conditions. This dynamic adjustment is achieved by constantly monitoring the voltage and current output of the solar panels and adjusting the load to maintain the maximum power point.
The MPPT operates by tracking the point on the solar panel's I-V curve where the power output is at its maximum. By doing so, it ensures that the solar panels are operating at their most efficient, even as sunlight conditions fluctuate throughout the day. This continuous adjustment allows the system to extract the maximum possible power from the solar panels, regardless of changes in temperature, shading, or other environmental factors that may affect their performance.
In contrast, option C is incorrect because while stabilizing the voltage output from the solar panels to a constant value simplifies the inverter design, it does not necessarily maximize power output. Option A is incorrect because MPPT does not isolate each solar panel to operate independently. Instead, it focuses on optimizing the overall system efficiency by continuously adjusting the electrical load. Option D is incorrect because while tracking the sun's position can improve efficiency, it requires additional mechanical components that increase system complexity and cost.
prompt 116:
Answer: B
Explanation: Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) are a key component in modern industrial motor applications, offering a range of benefits that enhance energy efficiency and overall operational performance. One of the primary ways a VFD improves energy efficiency is by adjusting the motor's electrical frequency and voltage to match the load requirement, thereby reducing excess energy consumption.
When a motor is operating at full capacity, it requires a higher electrical frequency and voltage to maintain its speed. However, in many industrial applications, the load demands fluctuate, and the motor may not be running at its maximum capacity for extended periods. This leads to unnecessary energy consumption and increased operating costs.
A VFD addresses this issue by adjusting the electrical frequency and voltage supplied to the motor in real-time, based on the load demand. When the load demand is low, the VFD reduces the frequency and voltage, allowing the motor to operate at a slower speed while consuming less energy. Conversely, when the load demand increases, the VFD increases the frequency and voltage to match the motor's speed requirements.
This dynamic adjustment of the motor's speed and energy consumption helps reduce excess energy consumption, which can lead to significant cost savings over time. By optimizing the motor's energy usage, a VFD contributes to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly industrial operation.
Furthermore, VFDs also provide precise control over the motor's speed, allowing for fine-tuning and customization based on specific application requirements. This flexibility enables operators to match the motor's speed to the load demand, reducing energy wastage and enhancing overall operational efficiency.
In conclusion, a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) improves energy efficiency in industrial motor applications by adjusting the motor's electrical frequency and voltage to match the load requirement. This dynamic adjustment reduces excess energy consumption, leading to cost savings and a more sustainable industrial operation. Additionally, VFDs offer precise speed control, further enhancing operational efficiency and energy savings.

E) RTLS can help reduce medical errors by providing real-time alerts for staff regarding the location of patients, equipment, and medications.
Answer: E
Explanation: Real-Time Locating Systems (RTLS) technology has the potential to significantly enhance workflow in a hospital setting. One of the key advantages of RTLS is its ability to provide real-time alerts for staff regarding the location of patients, equipment, and medications. This feature can help reduce medical errors, which are a significant concern in healthcare facilities. For example, if a patient is in distress and requires immediate attention, the RTLS system can alert the nearest available staff member, potentially saving valuable time in responding to the emergency.
Another benefit of RTLS is its ability to facilitate faster and more accurate decision-making. By providing precise location data for medical equipment, staff, and patients, the system can help healthcare professionals make informed decisions about resource allocation. This can lead to improved patient care and more efficient use of hospital resources.
RTLS can also automate inventory management for pharmaceuticals, which indirectly enhances workflow by ensuring medicine availability. This can reduce the time spent on manual inventory checks and potential delays in medication delivery, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
While RTLS technology offers numerous benefits, it does require a significant up-front investment. However, the potential cost savings and improved patient outcomes associated with the system can outweigh the initial expenses. As hospitals continue to seek ways to optimize their operations and improve patient care, RTLS technology is likely to play an increasingly important role in healthcare facilities.

Explanation: The immediate solution in this scenario is to replace the faulty switch immediately with a spare. This will minimize the disruption caused by the high packet loss experienced by the two endpoints on the network. The other options may help in the long term, but they are not immediate solutions to the problem at hand. Implementing Quality of Service (QoS) rules to prioritize critical traffic could help in the long term to ensure that critical traffic is not affected by the intermittent switch failure, but it will not solve the immediate problem of high packet loss. Configuring end-to-end retransmission protocols for all devices could help to minimize the impact of packet loss, but it is a long-term solution that requires configuration and testing. Analyzing traffic logs in real-time may help to pinpoint the exact source of failure, but it is not an immediate solution to the problem at hand.
prompt 121:
Explanation: D. Scheduling maintenance windows during off-peak hours is a proactive approach to redistribute connections and prevent unexpected traffic surges from overloading intermediate switches. Temporarily segmenting the network to isolate traffic spikes may help mitigate the impact of surges, but it does not address the root cause. Automatically throttling data rates for non-critical applications can help manage traffic, but it does not ensure network stability during a surge. Deploying additional virtual switches may be helpful in the long term, but it does not address immediate stability concerns.

Explanation: Organizations need to secure their networks against external threats to protect their data and systems from unauthorized access. One effective measure to achieve this is to enforce strict access controls and multi-factor authentication for remote connections. This ensures that only authorized users can access the network, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. It also adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide additional authentication factors, such as a password and a one-time password (OTP) generated by a mobile app, to gain access. Enforcing strict access controls and multi-factor authentication for remote connections is the most effective measure to secure an organization's network against external threats while providing remote access to its employees.

Explanation: Cloud-based storage solutions offer several advantages, including data availability and accessibility from multiple locations. However, it is crucial to have a strategy in place to ensure data availability even during local internet service disruptions. One effective strategy is to maintain local backups of all critical data. By doing so, organizations can ensure that their data remains accessible and available even if the cloud provider's services are disrupted or unavailable. This strategy provides redundancy and ensures that critical data can be accessed and used during times of internet service disruptions.
prompt 127:
Explanation: For an extended network using VLANs across multiple switches, the optimal configuration would be to implement a separate VLAN for each department and route inter-VLAN traffic through a dedicated firewall. This approach ensures optimal traffic segmentation, as each VLAN is isolated from others, preventing unauthorized access between departments. Additionally, the dedicated firewall provides an extra layer of security by filtering traffic between VLANs.
prompt 128:
Answer: A
Explanation: Subnetting is a method of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks, each with its own subnet mask. The subnet mask is used to determine the size of each subnet and the number of hosts that can be accommodated in each subnet. The subnet mask is a binary number that is used to identify the network and subnet parts of an IP address.
To adjust the subnet mask of a network to allow for more hosts per subnet, the network engineer can decrease the subnet mask length. This will reduce the number of bits used for subnetting, allowing for more bits to be used for the host part of the IP address. This will increase the number of hosts that can be accommodated in each subnet.
For example, if the current subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, which has a subnet mask length of 24, the network engineer can decrease the subnet mask length to 23 by changing the subnet mask to 255.255.254.0. This will increase the number of hosts that can be accommodated in each subnet from 254 to 510.
However, decreasing the subnet mask length will also reduce the number of subnets that can be created from the network. Therefore, the network engineer must ensure that the number of subnets remains constant when adjusting the subnet mask.

Answer: A
Explanation: Multinational companies often face challenges in managing international traffic due to a single network address. This can lead to routing inefficiencies and poor performance. To optimize both inbound and outbound traffic management, a readdressing strategy can be implemented. The most appropriate strategy in this case is to segment the network by geographical locations and assign local addresses for intra-region traffic.
Segmenting the network by geographical locations allows for more efficient routing of traffic within each region. By assigning local addresses for intra-region traffic, the company can reduce the burden on its global address and improve overall network performance. This strategy also helps in reducing latency and improving the quality of service for international traffic.
In contrast, implementing centralized routing control to manage all traffic through a single global address would not be an effective solution. While it may provide a simple solution, it would not address the underlying issue of routing inefficiencies caused by a single network address. Similarly, using a single, unified network protocol for all international communications may reduce complexity but would not optimize traffic management.
Maintaining a single address and increasing the bandwidth to handle higher traffic volumes may provide temporary relief but would not address the root cause of the problem. In the long run, this approach would still lead to routing inefficiencies and poor performance. Therefore, segmenting the network by geographical locations and assigning local addresses for intra-region traffic is the most appropriate strategy to optimize both inbound and outbound traffic management in this scenario.

Explanation: In BGP, tracking AS path lengths involves keeping track of the number of AS hops or the number of AS numbers in the AS path. When each AS number is assumed to be 2 bytes and each network number is 4 bytes, the memory requirement for tracking AS paths increases exponentially with the number of networks. This is because the AS path length is calculated by summing up the lengths of the individual AS paths, which can grow exponentially as the network expands. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Explanation: IPsec is a set of protocols that provides encryption and authentication services to IP packets. It is designed to provide security for IP traffic and it can be used in a variety of configurations. IPsec is a Layer 3 protocol and it operates at the network layer of the OSI model. IPsec is commonly used in VPNs to provide secure communication between two devices over an untrusted network. There are two phases in the IPsec protocol: Phase 1 and Phase 2.
Phase 1 is responsible for establishing the security association (SA). The SA is a set of security parameters that define how the IPsec protocol will be used to protect the data. The SA includes information such as the encryption algorithm, the authentication algorithm, and the keys that will be used. Phase 1 also establishes the security association database (SAD), which is a table that stores the SAs for each IPsec session.
Phase 2 is responsible for encrypting and authenticating the data. Phase 2 uses the SAs that were established in Phase 1 to protect the data. Phase 2 also uses the SAD to look up the SAs for each IPsec session.

The reason is because the address 2001:0489:000f:0000:0000:1f00:0000:000d is a 128-bit IPv6 address. To reduce it to a 64-bit address, we need to use the 64-bit format. The 64-bit format consists of 8 hexadecimal digits for the first two sections, followed by a colon, and then 4 hexadecimal digits for the last two sections. The first two sections are the network prefix, and the last two sections are the host identifier. The network prefix is 2001:0489:000f, and the host identifier is 1f00:0000:0000:000d. Therefore, the valid reduced version of the address is 2001:489:f::1f:0:d.

Explanation: A routing table is a list of routes. Each route is a destination and a gateway to use to reach that destination. The routing table is consulted when a packet needs to be sent to a destination that is not directly connected to the router.
The first step in finding a route is to find the longest prefix match. The longest prefix match is the route with the longest subnet mask that matches the destination address of the packet.
In this case, the destination address is 64.165.5.34. The subnet mask for that address is 255.255.255.0.
The first route that matches this destination is the route to the 64.165.5.0/24 network. This route is on interface WAN. The packet will be sent to the default gateway on interface WAN.
The other routes do not match the destination address of the packet.
The route to the 10.11.12.0/24 network does not match the destination address because the destination address is not in the 10.11.12.0/24 network.
The route to the 0.0.0.0/0 network does not match the destination address because the destination address is not in the 0.0.0.0/0 network.

Explanation: To calculate the total data transfer time, we need to consider both bandwidth and latency. The formula for calculating the total data transfer time is: Total Time = (Data Size / Bandwidth) + (Latency * Data Size). In this case, the data size is 500MB, which is equivalent to 500 x 1024 x 1024 = 524288000 bytes. The bandwidth is 100 Mbps, which is equivalent to 100 x 1024 x 1024 = 104857600 bits per second. The latency is 20 milliseconds, which is equivalent to 0.02 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken for the data transfer is: Total Time = (524288000 / 104857600) + (0.02 * 524288000) = 5 seconds + 104857600 seconds = 5 seconds + 104857600 / 60 seconds = 5 seconds + 1743680 seconds = 5 seconds + 1743680 / 60 seconds = 5 seconds + 28993.467 seconds = 5 seconds + 28993.467 / 60 seconds = 5 seconds + 483.221 seconds = 5 seconds + 483.221 / 60 seconds = 5 seconds + 8.052 seconds = 13.052 seconds.

Explanation: During peak usage hours, a cloud service provider may experience performance degradation due to high traffic levels. To address this issue, the cloud service provider can implement load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers. This strategy ensures that each server is handling a fair share of the load, improving overall performance and reducing the risk of performance degradation. Upgrading the physical hardware of the data centers may help in the long term, but it does not address the immediate issue of performance degradation during peak usage hours. Increasing the number of virtual machines available may help in the long term, but it does not address the immediate issue of performance degradation during peak usage hours. Expanding the storage capacity of the servers may help in the long term, but it does not address the immediate issue of performance degradation during peak usage hours.

Explanation: Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an authentication method that requires the use of two different types of credentials to verify a user's identity for a login or other transaction. The first credential is typically something the user knows, such as a password or PIN, while the second credential is something the user has, such as a security token or smartphone. 2FA is designed to provide an additional layer of security beyond a single password or PIN, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information.

Explanation: A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a type of cyber attack where multiple compromised systems are used to target a single system, with the intent of overwhelming it with traffic. In such an attack, the attacker does not need to have any direct access to the targeted system. Instead, they can use a botnet or a network of compromised systems to launch the attack.
In the given scenario, the network security analyst detects unusual traffic patterns that suggest a possible DDoS attack. The most effective immediate response to mitigate the impact of a DDoS attack is to block traffic from suspicious IP addresses. By blocking traffic from these IP addresses, the analyst can prevent the attack from continuing and minimize the impact on the network.
Shutting down the entire network is not an effective response because it would result in a complete shutdown of all services and resources, which would have a significant impact on the organization's operations. Upgrading the network bandwidth may be a long-term solution, but it would not be effective in immediately mitigating the impact of a DDoS attack.
Notifying all users to log out of the system is also not an effective response because it would not prevent the attack from continuing. The attack would still be ongoing, and the users would not be able to access the system until the attack is mitigated.

Explanation: The initial sequence number is to be derived using a time-of-day (ToD) clock that keeps running even when the host is down. The low order 32 bits of the counter of the ToD clock is to be used for the initial sequence numbers. The clock counter increments once per millisecond. The maximum packet lifetime is given to be 64s. Hence, the minimum permissible rate at which sequence numbers used for packets of a connection can increase is 327/s.

Explanation: In this question, the efficiency of the stop and wait protocol is given as 25%.
Efficiency = 1 – (propagation delay / packet transmission time)
Efficiency = 1 – (2 * propagation delay / packet transmission time)
1 – 0.25 = 2 * propagation delay / packet transmission time
0.75 = 2 * propagation delay / packet transmission time
propagation delay = 0.75 * packet transmission time / 2
propagation delay = 0.75 * (1000 bytes * 8 bits / byte) / (2 * 10^6 bits/sec)

Explanation: The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). It is occasionally known as the Department of Defense (DoD) model because the development of the networking model was funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.
The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed and received. It defines how to establish and terminate a connection between a communicating pair. The Internet protocol suite can also be considered as a general networking protocol framework that underlies all of the above. Developing the suite was a collaborative effort starting in the late 1960s and early 1970s, coordinated by the DoD. The term internet protocol suite originally referred to the set of protocols based on the Internet protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Today, however, it is used to refer to the suite of protocols based on the Internet protocol (IP), including TCP, but also including many other protocols as well.

The current transmit window is increased by 2 for the first ACK and then again by 2 for the second ACK. So the current transmit window increases by 4. As the current transmit window was 4000 bytes, the maximum possible value of the current transmit window is 4000 + 4 = 8000 bytes.

Answer: A
Explanation: The traceroute command works by sending a packet to a remote host and progressively increasing the time-to-live (TTL) field in the IP header of the packet. When a router receives a packet, it decrements the TTL field by 1. If the TTL field reaches 0, the packet is discarded and an ICMP Time Exceeded message is sent to the source. The traceroute command listens for these Time Exceeded messages and prints the IP address of the router that sent the message. The traceroute command is used to identify the path that a packet takes from the source to the destination.

Explanation: The subnet mask is the number of bits in the subnet address. The number of bits in the subnet address can be calculated by counting the number of leading 1s in the subnet mask. The number of bits in the host address can be calculated by subtracting the number of bits in the subnet address from the total number of bits in the IP address.
The number of bits in the IP address is 32 because an IP address is 32 bits long.
The number of bits in the subnet address is 8 because the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, and the number of leading 1s is 8.
The number of bits in the host address is 24 because the number of bits in the subnet address is 8, and the number of bits in the IP address is 32.
The number of hosts is 2n - 2, where n is the number of bits in the host address.
The number of hosts is 24 - 2, or 16,768, because the number of bits in the host address is 24.
The number of hosts is 2n - 2, where n is the number of bits in the host address.
The number of hosts is 25 - 2, or 32, because the number of bits in the host address is 25.

After transmitting 8 frames, sender will receive 8 acknowledgments.
Sender will receive the 9th acknowledgment only after 9 frames are transmitted by receiver.
Hence, sender will have to wait for 9*16ms = 144ms before starting transmission of the next frame.
So, the minimum time the sender will have to wait before starting transmission of the next frame is 144ms.

Explanation: The minimum frame size required for a CSMA/CD based computer network running at 1 Gbps on a 200m cable with a link speed of 2 × 10^8 m/s is 250 bytes.
For CSMA/CD, the minimum frame size is given by
Minimum Frame Size = 2 × (2L/B) × 8
L = Length of the cable
B = Bandwidth of the cable
= 2 × (2 × 200 × 10^3)/(1 × 10^9) × 8
= 250 bytes

Explanation: In Stop and Wait, efficiency of channel is given by
E = (1-p)/ (1+p)
If we want to send big packets on the channel, then Stop and Wait is not a good choice as it has very low efficiency. If length of packet increases, efficiency of channel decreases. Distance between sender and receiver is not directly proportional to efficiency of channel. Efficiency is not less if capacity of channel is high.
The efficiency of a channel is given by
E = (1-p)/ (1+p)
Here p is the probability of error. The efficiency of channel is maximum when p = 0 and minimum when p = 1.

Answer: D) KILL is a blockable signal.
Explanation: KILL is a non-blockable signal.
INT signal is sent by the terminal driver when one types and it is a request to terminate the current operation. TERM is a request to terminate execution completely. The receiving process will clean up its state and exit. QUIT is similar to TERM, except that it defaults to producing a core dump if not caught.

Answer: D
Explanation: In the Ethernet, the preamble is actually added at the physical layer and is not part of the frame.
prompt 323:
Answer: A
Explanation: Stop and Wait protocol is an ARQ protocol. So, the efficiency will be given by the ratio of the time taken for the transmission of the frame to the total time taken for the transmission of the frame.
Time taken for the transmission of the frame = 20 ns
Propagation time = 30 ns
Total time taken for the transmission of the frame = 50 ns
So, efficiency = 20 ns / 50 ns = 40%
So, the correct answer is "A".

Explanation: A private IP address is one that is assigned to a device on a private network. Private IP addresses are typically assigned to devices on a home network, or on a network within a company. Private IP addresses are not routable on the Internet. Private IP addresses are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The IANA has assigned three ranges of IP addresses as private: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix) 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix) 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix) Ref: https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/ccna-tutorial/private-ip-address
