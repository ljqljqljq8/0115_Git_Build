"In a web server, ten WebPages are stored with the URLs of the form http://www.yourname.com/var.html, where var is a different number from 1 to 10 for each Webpage. Suppose, the client stores the Webpage with var = 1 (say W1) in the local machine, edits and then tests. The rest of the WebPages remain on the web server. W1 contains several relative URLs of the form “var.html” referring to the other WebPages. Which one of the following statements needs to be added in W1, so that all the relative URLs in W1 refer to the appropriate WebPages on the web server?

A) <a.href: ""http://www.yourname.com/"", href: ""...var.html"">
B) <base href=""http://www.yourname.com/"">
C) <a.href: ""http://www.yourname.com/"">
D) <base href=""http://www.yourname.com/"", range: ""...var.html"">","B) <base href=""http://www.yourname.com/"">","Correct answer:
B) <base href=""http://www.yourname.com/"">
Explanation:
The question requires understanding of how relative URLs are resolved in a web server. Relative URLs are resolved by the web server based on the base URL of the document. To ensure that all relative URLs in a document refer to the appropriate WebPages on the web server, the base URL of the document must be specified.

"For a host machine that uses the token bucket algorithm for congestion control, the token bucket has a capacity of 1 megabyte and the maximum output rate is 20 megabytes per second. Tokens arrive at a rate to sustain output at a rate of 10 megabytes per second. The token bucket is currently full and the machine needs to send 12 megabytes of data. The minimum time required to transmit the data is _________________ seconds.

A) 1.1
B) 0.1
C) 2.1
D) 2.0
",A) 1.1,"Explanation:
The question is about the minimum time required to transmit data using the token bucket algorithm for congestion control in a host machine. The token bucket algorithm is used to control the rate at which data is transmitted from a source to a destination. It is a form of rate-based congestion control that is used in networks to avoid congestion.

"Consider a TCP connection in a state where there are no outstanding ACKs. The sender sends two segments back to back. The sequence numbers of the first and second segments are 230 and 290 respectively. The first segment was lost, but the second segment was received correctly by the receiver. Let X be the amount of data carried in the first segment (in bytes), and Y be the ACK number sent by the receiver. The values of X and Y (in that order) are

"Consider an uncompressed stereo audio signal of CD quality which is sampled at 44.1 kHz and quantized using 16 bits. What is the required storage space if a compression ratio of 0.5 is achieved for 10 seconds of this audio?

A) 172 KB
B) 430 KB
C) 860 KB
D) 1720 KB
",C) 860 KB,"Explanation:

To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of storage space required for a compressed audio signal. When we compress an audio signal, we reduce its size by removing redundant or unnecessary data. The compression ratio determines how much data is removed from the original signal. In this case, the compression ratio is 0.5, which means that 50% of the original data is removed during compression.
