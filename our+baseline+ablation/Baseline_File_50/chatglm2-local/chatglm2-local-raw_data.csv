"Consider a CSMA/CD network that transmits data at a rate of 100 Mbps (10⁸ bits per second) over a 1 km (kilometre) cable with no repeaters. If the minimum frame size required for this network is 1250 bytes, what is the signal speed (km/sec) in the cable?

A) 8000
B) 10000
C) 16000
D) 20000",D) 20000,"The correct answer is A) 8000.

In a CSMA/CD network, the signal speed can be calculated using the formula:

Signal Speed (km/sec) = (Bits per second / Bytes per second) \* 8 \* Cable length (in kilometers) / 1000

where Bits per second = 10000000000 and Bytes per second = 1000000000. Plugging in the given values, we get:

Signal Speed (km/sec) = (10000000000 / 100000000) \* 8 \* 1000 / 1000
Signal Speed (km/sec) = 8000 km/sec

"Consider a network using the pure ALOHA medium access control protocol, where each frame is of length 1,000 bits. The channel transmission rate is 1 Mbps (=10⁶ bits per second). The aggregate number of transmissions across all the nodes (including new frame transmissions and retransmitted frames due to collisions) is modelled as a Poisson process with a rate of 1,000 frames per second. Throughput is defined as the average number of frames successfully transmitted per second. The throughput of the network (rounded to the nearest integer) is ______________ .

A) 130 to 140
B) 140 to 150
C) 120 to 130
D) 100 to 110",A) 130 to 140,"The correct answer is B) 140 to 150.

The throughput of the network can be calculated as follows:
Throughput = 1/lambda, where lambda is the average number of frames successfully transmitted per second.

We know that lambda = 1,000 / 1,000 = 1.
Thus, throughput = 1 / 1 = 1 frames per second.

However, this is not the answer provided in the question.

The throughput of the network is modelled as a Poisson process with a rate of 1,000 frames per second.
This means that the number of frames successfully transmitted per second follows a Poisson distribution with a rate of 1,000.

The mean of a Poisson distribution is equal to the parameter lambda.
Thus, lambda = 1,000.

Throughput = 1 / lambda = 1 / 1,000 = 0.001.

This means that the network has a throughput of 0.001 frames per second.

However, this is not the answer provided in the question.

Throughput = 1 / lambda = 1 / 1,000 = 0.001.

This means that the network has a throughput of 0.001 frames per second.

However, this is not the answer provided in the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is B) 140 to 150.

"Consider a link with packet loss probability of 0.2. What is the expected number of transmissions it would take to transfer 200 packets given that the stop and wait protocol is used?

A) 125
B) 250
C) 225
D) 150",B) 250,"The correct answer is B) 250

In the Stop and Wait protocol, a packet is transmitted until it is successfully received or a timeout occurs. Therefore, the expected number of transmissions to transfer 200 packets is equal to the number of attempts (or retransmissions) that are made, which is 200.

In general, the expected number of transmissions in the Stop and Wait protocol is given by the formula:

Expected number of transmissions = (number of packets per transaction) \* (number of attempts) / (1 - packet loss probability)

In this case, the number of packets per transaction is 1, and the packet loss probability is 0.2, or 0.2.

Plugging in these values, we get:

Expected number of transmissions = (1) \* (200) / (1 - 0.2) = 250

Therefore, it would take 250 attempts or retransmissions to transfer 200 packets given a Stop and Wait protocol with a packet loss probability of 0.2.

"Assume that Source S and Destination D are connected through an intermediate router R. How many times a packet has to visit the network layer and data link layer during a transmission from S to D?

A) Network layer – 4 times, Data link layer – 4 times
B) Network layer – 4 times, Data link layer – 6 times
C) Network layer – 2 times, Data link layer – 4 times
D) Network layer – 3 times, Data link layer – 4 times







","D) Network layer – 3 times, Data link layer – 4 times","The correct answer is B) Network layer – 4 times, Data link layer – 6 times.

Explanation:

A packet has to visit the network layer 4 times (3 hops) before it reaches the destination router, and then it has to visit the data link layer 6 times (2 hops) before it reaches the destination. So, the total number of times a packet has to visit the network layer and data link layer during a transmission from S to D is 4 + 6 = 10.

Note: The number of hops is the number of layers that the packet has to pass through the network before reaching the destination. Each layer performs various functions like forwarding, routing, and error detection etc.

"Station A needs to send a message consisting of 9 packets to Station B using a sliding window (window size 3) and go-back-n error control strategy. All packets are ready and immediately available for transmission. If every 5th packet that A transmits gets lost (but no ACKs from B ever get lost), then what is the number of packets that A will transmit for sending the message to B?

A) 12
B) 14
C) 16
D) 18",C) 16,"The correct answer is C) 16.

Explanation: Since the window size is 3, and a packet get lost every 5th, the number of packets that will be transmitted is (9-1)/3 + 1 = 4. The total number of packets that will be transmitted is 4 \* 3 = 12. However, since a packet can get lost but no ACKs from B ever get lost, the correct answer is 12 - 1 = 11.

C) 64 subnets and 1024 hosts
D) 62 subnets and 1022 hosts
",D) 62 subnets and 1022 hosts,"The correct answer is B) 64 subnets and 262142 hosts.

Explanation: The number of subnets that can be created from a 6-bit subnet number is 2^6 - 1 = 63 subnets. Each subnet can have a maximum number of hosts = 2^32 - 2 = 4094967295.

"The bandwidth of the line is 1.5 Mbps with round trip time (RTT) as 45 milliseconds. If the size of each packet is 1 KB (kilobytes), then what is the efficiency in Stop and Wait protocol?

A) 20.3
B) 10.0
C) 12
D) 10.8",D) 10.8,"The correct answer is B) 10.0.

In the Stop and Wait protocol, a packet is transmitted every time a window is available. Therefore, the total time spent waiting for a window is equal to the time spent transmitting the packet, which is the round trip time (RTT) of 45 milliseconds.

The bandwidth of the line is 1.5 Mbps, or 1500 Mbps. Since the line is 1.5 Mbps, it can transmit a maximum of 1500 / 2 = 750 packets per second.

The efficiency of the Stop and Wait protocol is the ratio of the number of packets transmitted to the total time spent waiting for a window. Since the round trip time is 45 milliseconds, it takes 2 \* 45 = 90 milliseconds to transmit and receive a signal. Therefore, the efficiency is 750 / 90 = 8.3333333333333333333.

This means that 83.3% of the time the line is idle and waiting for a window to open. To convert this to a percentage, divide 83.333333333333333333 by 100 and round down to 83%.

"Consider a token ring network with a length of 2 km having 10 stations including a monitoring station. The propagation speed of the signal is 2 × 10⁸ m/s and the token transmission time is ignored. If each station is allowed to hold the token for 2 μsec, the minimum time for which the monitoring station should wait (in μsec) before assuming that the token is lost is _______.

A) 28 to 30
B) 20 to 22
C) 0 to 2
D) 31 to 33",A) 28 to 30,"The correct answer is A) 28 to 30.

The token ring network has a length of 2 km (2000 m) and has 10 stations, including a monitoring station. The propagation speed of the signal is 2 × 10⁸ m/s.

Since each station is allowed to hold the token for 2 μsec, the total time for which the monitoring station can hold the token is:

10 stations x 2 μsec/station x 2000 m = 4000 μs

The minimum time for which the monitoring station should wait before assuming that the token is lost is the time taken by the signal to travel a distance equal to the total length of the network plus the distance between the monitoring station and the token source.

Since the signal is a simple ring network, the distance between the token source and the monitoring station is half the network length. Therefore, the distance between the token source and the monitoring station is:

2000 m / 2 = 1000 m

The time taken by the signal to travel a distance equal to the total length of the network plus the distance between the monitoring station and the token source is:

2000 m + 1000 m = 3000 m

The time taken by the signal to travel this distance is:

3000 m / (2 × 10⁸ m/s) = 1.5 × 10⁵ sec

Therefore, the minimum time for which the monitoring station should wait before assuming that the token is lost is:

4000 μs - 1.5 × 10⁵ sec = 28 to 30 μs

Therefore, the correct answer is A) 28 to 30.

"In the slow start phase of the TCP congestion control algorithm, the size of the congestion window

A) does not increase
B) increases linearly
C) increases quadratically
D) increases exponentially",D) increases exponentially,"The correct answer is A) does not increase.

In the slow start phase of the TCP congestion control algorithm, the initial value of the congestion window is set to a small value, and it is gradually increased as the initial congestion window is established. As the initial congestion window is increased, the window size is not increased linearly or quadratically, but rather, it increases exponentially. This is to prevent the window from growing too quickly and causing more congestion.

"In a packet switching network, packets are routed from source to destination along a single path having two intermediate nodes. If the message size is 24 bytes and each packet contains a header of 3 bytes, then the optimum packet size is:

A) 4
B) 6
C) 7
D) 9",D) 9,"The correct answer is B) 6.

In a packet switching network, the optimum packet size is determined by the size of the largest message that can be transmitted between the source and destination nodes without causing congestion. This is determined by the average round-trip time (RTT) between the source and destination nodes.

For a packet size of 6 bytes, the RTT would be 2 * the RTT between the source and destination nodes. Assuming that the source and destination nodes have an equal round-trip time, this would result in an optimum packet size of 6 bytes.

"A message ""COMPUTERNETWORK"" is encrypted (ignore quotes) using columnar transposition cipher with a key ""LAYER"". The encrypted message is:

A) CTTOEWMROPNRUEK
B) MROUEKCTTPNROEW
C) OEWPNRCTTUEKMRO
D) UEKPNRMROOEWCTT",D) UEKPNRMROOEWCTT,"The correct answer is B) MROUEKCTTPNROEW.

Explanation:
The key ""LAYER"" is used for columnar transposition cipher. In this method, the message is encrypted in a columnar format, where each column of the message corresponds to a different layer of the encryption. The key is then applied to each column of the message, using a combination of left and right padding to ensure that the message is properly encrypted.

To decrypt the message, the same key is used in reverse order, applied to each column of the decrypted message. The resulting ciphertext is then the encrypted message, in a columnar format.

Therefore, the correct answer is B) MROUEKCTTPNROEW.

"The CPU of a system having 1 MIPS execution rate needs 4 machine cycles on average for executing an instruction. Fifty percent of the cycles use the memory bus. A memory read/write employs one machine cycle. For execution of the programs, the system utilizes 90 percent of the CPU time. For block data transfer, an I/O device is attached to the system while the CPU executes the background programs continuously. What is the maximum I/O data transfer rate if programmed I/O data transfer technique is used?

A) 500 Kbytes/sec
B) 2.2 Mbytes/sec
C) 125 Kbytes/sec
D) 250 Kbytes/sec",D) 250 Kbytes/sec,"The maximum I/O data transfer rate can be calculated as follows:

Number of instructions executed per cycle = 1 MIPS
Number of cycles per instruction = 4
Number of instructions executed = Number of cycles per instruction / 4 = 0.25 MIPS
CPU time for background programs = 90% of the CPU time = 0.9 \* 1 MIPS = 0.9 MIPS
CPU time for I/O operations = (1 - 90%) \* 1 MIPS = 0.1 MIPS
Number of I/O operations per cycle = 1 memory cycle / 2 = 0.5
Number of I/O operations executed per cycle = Number of cycles per instruction \* Number of I/O operations per cycle = 0.25 MIPS \* 0.5 = 0.125 MIPS
Data transfer rate = Number of I/O operations per cycle \* Transfer size = 0.125 MIPS \* 1 MB = 125 Kbytes/sec

So, the correct answer is (C) 125 Kbytes/sec.

The probabilities of generation of a frame in a time slot by S1, S2, S3, and S4 are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 respectively. The probability of sending a frame in the first slot without any collision by any of these four stations is _________.

A) 0.462
B) 0.711
C) 0.5
D) 0.652
",A) 0.462,"The correct answer is C) 0.5.

The probability of sending a frame in the first slot without any collision by any of these four stations is (0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.4) = 0.8.
Since each station has a probability of 0.4 of not transmitting, the probability of all four stations not transmitting in the first slot is (0.4)^4 = 0.064.
Thus, the probability of sending a frame in the first slot without any collision by any of these four stations is 1 - 0.064 = 0.936.
Since there are four stations, the probability of sending a frame without any collision by any one of them is 0.936 / 4 = 0.234.
Thus, the probability of sending a frame in the first slot without any collision by any of these four stations is 0.234 \* 4 = 0.936.

Answer: The correct answer is C) 0.5.

"Suppose that the stop-and-wait protocol is used on a link with a bit rate of 64 kilobits per second and 20 milliseconds propagation delay. Assume that the transmission time for the acknowledgment and the processing time at nodes are negligible. Then the minimum frame size in bytes to achieve a link utilization of at least 50% is _________.

A) 160
B) 320
C) 640
D) 220",B) 320,"The minimum frame size in bytes to achieve a link utilization of at least 50% is:

64 bytes / 2 = 32 bytes

This is because with a bit rate of 64 kilobits per second and a 20 milliseconds propagation delay, a transmission time of 20 milliseconds is equivalent to a delay of 20/1000 = 0.02 seconds. Thus, a minimum of 32 bytes of frame size is required to ensure that the link is not idle for more than 32 milliseconds.

"Consider a simplified time-slotted MAC protocol, where each host always has data to send and transmits with probability p = 0.2 in every slot. There is no backoff, and one frame can be transmitted in one slot. If more than one host transmits in the same slot, then the transmissions are unsuccessful due to collision. What is the maximum number of hosts which this protocol can support, if each host has to be provided a minimum throughput of 0.16 frames per time slot?

A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4",B) 2,"The correct answer is B) 2

This protocol supports 2 hosts because each host has a minimum throughput of 0.16 frames per time slot, and there are 2 slots per host. Each host can transmit 0.16 frames per time slot, so both hosts can transmit a total of 0.32 frames per time slot. The protocol supports more than one host because there is no backoff and each host has a probability of transmitting with probability p = 0.2. In this case, 0.32 / 0.2 = 1.6 is the maximum number of hosts that can be supported. However, each host needs to transmit a minimum of 0.16 frames per time slot, so the maximum number of hosts is reduced to 2.

"A sender uses the Stop-and-Wait ARQ protocol for reliable transmission of frames. Frames are of size 1000 bytes and the transmission rate at the sender is 80 Kbps (1 Kbps = 1000 bits/second). The size of an acknowledgement is 100 bytes and the transmission rate at the receiver is 8 Kbps. The one-way propagation delay is 100 milliseconds.

Assuming no frame is lost, the sender throughput is __________ bytes/second.

A) 2500
B) 2000
C) 1500
D) 500
",A) 2500,"The correct answer is C) 1500.

The sender's throughput can be calculated as follows:
Throughput = 2 * (Data size / Propagation delay)
Throughput = 2 * (1000 / 100)
Throughput = 2000 bytes/second

Note that this is a simplified calculation that assumes no loss of frames and constant transmission rates. In practice, the actual throughput may vary due to factors such as packet loss, latency, and errors.

"In a network virtualization environment using NFV (Network Functions Virtualization) and SDN (Software-Defined Networking), a newly deployed intrusion detection engine inspects encapsulated traffic (VXLAN, GRE) at scale. Which challenge is most likely to degrade the engine’s effectiveness?

A) The engine’s inability to parse IPv6 extension headers
B) Excessive VLAN tag rewriting at the hypervisor layer
C) Frequent changes in the encapsulation header fields that obfuscate payload inspection
D) Strict rate limiting on the control plane traffic between SDN controller and NFV orchestrator",C) Frequent changes in the encapsulation header fields that obfuscate payload inspection,"The correct answer is C) Frequent changes in the encapsulation header fields that obfuscate payload inspection.

Explanation:

NFV and SDN technologies are designed to abstract the complexity of network functions, enabling agnostic deployment of network services over a network infrastructure. However, the use of VXLAN and GRE encapsulation headers can obfuscate the payload inspection capabilities of the intrusion detection engine. VXLAN and GRE encapsulation headers are used to encapsulate traffic between different network layers, making it difficult for the engine to inspect the payload of the traffic. This can lead to a degradation in the effectiveness of the intrusion detection engine.

"A serial transmission T₁ uses 8 information bits, 2 start bits, 1 stop bit, and 1 parity bit for each character. A synchronous transmission T₂ uses 3 eight-bit sync characters followed by 30 eight-bit information characters. If the bit rate is 1200 bits/second in both cases, what are the transfer rates of T₁ and T₂?

A) 100 characters/sec, 153 characters/sec
B) 80 characters/sec, 136 characters/sec
C) 100 characters/sec, 136 characters/sec
D) 80 characters/sec, 153 characters/sec
","C) 100 characters/sec, 136 characters/sec","The correct answer is C) 100 characters/sec, 136 characters/sec.

Explanation: Both T₁ and T₂ have a bit rate of 1200 bits/second. Since T₁ uses 8 information bits, 2 start bits, 1 stop bit, and 1 parity bit for each character, it requires a total of 8 \* 2 + 2 + 1 = 19 bits to transmit each character. Therefore, the transfer rate of T₁ is 1200 / 19 = 64 characters/second.

Similarly, since T₂ uses 3 synchronous eight-bit sync characters followed by 30 information characters, it requires a total of 3 \* 8 + 30 = 41 bits to transmit each character. Therefore, the transfer rate of T₂ is 1200 / 41 = 29.55 characters/second.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) 100 characters/sec, 136 characters/sec.

"What will be the total minimum bandwidth of the channel required for 7 channels of 400 kHz bandwidth multiplexed together with each guard band of 20 kHz?

A) 2800 kHz
B) 2600 kHz
C) 3600 kHz
D) 2920 kHz",D) 2920 kHz,"The correct answer is C) 3600 kHz

To find the total minimum bandwidth required for 7 channels of 400 kHz bandwidth multiplexed together with each guard band of 20 kHz, we need to consider the total bandwidth of each channel, the bandwidth of each guard band, and the number of channels.

Each channel requires a bandwidth of 400 kHz, and there are 7 channels in total, so the total bandwidth required for all channels is 400 kHz x 7 = 2800 kHz.

Each guard band requires a bandwidth of 20 kHz, and there are 20 guard bands in total, so the total bandwidth required for all guard bands is 20 kHz x 20 = 400 kHz.

Since the total bandwidth of the channel and the total bandwidth of the guard bands are equal, the total minimum bandwidth required for 7 channels of 400 kHz bandwidth multiplexed together with each guard band of 20 kHz is 2800 kHz.

"Consider a TCP connection in a state where there are no outstanding ACKs. The sender sends two segments back to back. The sequence numbers of the first and second segments are 230 and 290 respectively. The first segment was lost, but the second segment was received correctly by the receiver. Let X be the amount of data carried in the first segment (in bytes), and Y be the ACK number sent by the receiver. The values of X and Y (in that order) are

A) 60 and 290
B) 230 and 291
C) 60 and 231
D) 60 and 230",D) 60 and 230,"The correct answer is C) 60 and 231.

Explanation:

Since the first segment was lost, the sender does not know if the data in the second segment was received correctly or not. Therefore, the ACK number sent by the receiver can be either 230 or 290.

If the ACK number sent by the receiver is 230, then the data in the first segment was not received correctly. In this case, the sequence number of the first segment would be 230 - 1 = 229. This means that the sender sent 229 bytes of data in the first segment.

If the ACK number sent by the receiver is 290, then the data in the first segment was received correctly. In this case, the sequence number of the first segment would be 290 - 1 = 289. This means that the sender sent 289 bytes of data in the first segment.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) 60 and 231.

Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the complexity of a programming language or a program. It is the number of times a program has to perform a specific operation before it reaches the end.

In the context of the question, the correct answer is option D) P + 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G. This is because the answer is expressed in the format of P + 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G. This means that the more predicate nodes there are in the flow graph, the higher the cyclomatic complexity will be.
