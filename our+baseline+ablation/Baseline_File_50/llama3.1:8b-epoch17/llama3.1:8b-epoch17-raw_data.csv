"Station A needs to send a message consisting of 9 packets to Station B using a sliding window (window size 3) and go-back-n error control strategy. All packets are ready and immediately available for transmission. If every 5th packet that A transmits gets lost (but no ACKs from B ever get lost), then what is the number of packets that A will transmit for sending the message to B?

A) 12
B) 14
C) 16
D) 18",C) 16,"Correct answer:
B) 14
Explanation:
This question is about calculating the number of packets that need to be transmitted from Station A to Station B using a sliding window (window size 3) and go-back-n error control strategy, where every 5th packet gets lost.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is B) 14. When using a sliding window (window size 3) and go-back-n error control strategy, the number of packets transmitted to send a message consisting of 9 packets would be 3 (the window size) multiplied by the number of transmissions required to send the message. In this case, since 5 packets get lost, the number of transmissions required is 9/5 = 1.8. Therefore, the number of packets transmitted is 3 x 1.8 = 5.4. Since the number of packets must be an integer, the number of packets transmitted is 14.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) 12
Why Incorrect: This is not the correct number of packets because it doesn't account for the lost packets and the need to retransmit them.
Wrong answer: C) 16
Why Incorrect: This number is too high because it doesn't take into account the lost packets and the need to retransmit them.
Wrong answer: D) 18
Why Incorrect: This is not the correct number of packets because it doesn't account for the lost packets and the need to retransmit them.

"Station A uses 32 byte packets to transmit messages to Station B using a sliding window protocol. The round trip delay between A and B is 80 milliseconds and the bottleneck bandwidth on the path between A and B is 128 kbps. What is the optimal window size that A should use?

A) 20
B) 40
C) 160
D) 320",B) 40,"Correct answer:
D) 320
Explanation:
The question is asking for the optimal window size for a sliding window protocol based on the round trip delay and bottleneck bandwidth between two stations.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The optimal window size can be calculated using the formula: Window Size = Bottleneck Bandwidth / (Packet Size * RTT). In this case, the optimal window size is 320, as the packet size is 32 bytes (0.032 MB), the RTT is 80 ms, and the bottleneck bandwidth is 128 kbps (0.128 MB/s). Therefore, the optimal window size is 320 (0.128 MB/s / (0.032 MB * 80 ms)).
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) 20
        Why Incorrect: This value is too small as it does not account for the full capacity of the bottleneck bandwidth.
Wrong answer: B) 40
        Why Incorrect: This value is too small and does not take advantage of the full capacity of the bottleneck bandwidth.
Wrong answer: C) 160
        Why Incorrect: This value is too large and could result in a higher probability of packet loss due to buffer overflow.

"The address of a class B host is to be split into subnets with a 6-bit subnet number. What is the maximum number of subnets and the maximum number of hosts in each subnet?

A) 62 subnets and 262142 hosts
B) 64 subnets and 262142 hosts
C) 64 subnets and 1024 hosts
D) 62 subnets and 1022 hosts
",D) 62 subnets and 1022 hosts,"Explanation:
The question asks for the maximum number of subnets and hosts in each subnet when a class B host address is split into subnets with a 6-bit subnet number.
The correct answer is: A) 62 subnets and 262142 hosts. This is because, given a 6-bit subnet number, the maximum number of subnets is 2^6-2 (62), and the maximum number of hosts in each subnet is 2^16-2 (65534), minus the subnet and broadcast addresses, which leaves 262142 hosts.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The formula to calculate the maximum number of hosts in a subnet is 2^N - 2, where N is the number of host bits. In this case, N is 16 (since we have 16 bits for the host portion of the address), which gives us 2^16 - 2 = 65534. However, we must subtract two addresses, one for the subnet and one for the broadcast, which leaves us with 262142 hosts.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: B) 64 subnets and 262142 hosts
        Why Incorrect: The maximum number of subnets is actually 62, not 64, due to the subnet mask. The correct answer is A) 62 subnets and 262142 hosts.
Wrong answer: C) 64 subnets and 1024 hosts
        Why Incorrect: The maximum number of subnets is actually 62, not 64, due to the subnet mask. Also, the maximum number of hosts in each subnet is 262142, not 1024, due to the number of host bits.
Wrong answer: D) 62 subnets and 1022 hosts
        Why Incorrect: The maximum number of subnets is actually 62, not 64, due to the subnet mask. Also, the maximum number of hosts in each subnet is 262142, not 1022, due to the number of host bits.

"In a network of LANs connected by bridges, packets are sent from one LAN to another through intermediate bridges. Since more than one path may exist between two LANs, packets may have to be routed through multiple bridges. Why is the spanning tree algorithm used for bridge-routing?

A) For shortest path routing between LANs
B) For avoiding loops in the routing paths
C) For fault tolerance
D) For minimizing collisions
",B) For avoiding loops in the routing paths,"Correct answer:
B) For avoiding loops in the routing paths
Explanation:
This question explores the rationale behind the use of the spanning tree algorithm in bridge-routing within a network of LANs. Bridge-routing involves sending packets from one LAN to another through intermediate bridges, and this can occur through multiple paths due to the interconnected nature of the network.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is B) For avoiding loops in the routing paths. The spanning tree algorithm is used in bridge-routing to ensure that there are no loops in the routing paths. By creating a spanning tree from the interconnected LANs, the algorithm ensures that there is a single path between any two LANs, preventing packets from circulating endlessly.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) For shortest path routing between LANs
    Why Incorrect: While the spanning tree algorithm may result in a shortest path between LANs, its primary purpose is to avoid loops, not necessarily to achieve the shortest path.
Wrong answer: C) For fault tolerance
    Why Incorrect: While fault tolerance is a desirable property in networks, the spanning tree algorithm specifically addresses the issue of loops, not directly the ability to withstand faults.
Wrong answer: D) For minimizing collisions
    Why Incorrect: The spanning tree algorithm does not directly minimize collisions. Its main purpose is to create a loop-free topology, which indirectly may help reduce collisions by preventing packet retransmissions.

A) 1.6 seconds
B) 2 seconds
C) 5 seconds
D) 8 seconds",B) 2 seconds,"Correct answer:
A) 1.6 seconds
Explanation:
The question is asking about the maximum duration for which a computer can transmit at the full speed of 10 Mbps when it is regulated by a token bucket. The token bucket is filled at a rate of 2 Mbps, and it is initially filled to capacity with 16 Megabits.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is A) 1.6 seconds. The maximum duration for which the computer can transmit at the full 10 Mbps is 1.6 seconds. This is because the token bucket is initially filled to capacity with 16 Megabits and the token bucket is filled at a rate of 2 Mbps. So, in 1.6 seconds, 2 Mbps will fill the token bucket with 3.2 Megabits, leaving 12.8 Megabits in the token bucket. Since the computer can transmit at a rate of 10 Mbps, it can use up the remaining 12.8 Megabits in 1.6 seconds.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: B) 2 seconds
Why Incorrect: This is incorrect because the token bucket is initially filled to capacity with 16 Megabits and it is filled at a rate of 2 Mbps. In 2 seconds, 2 Mbps will fill the token bucket with 4 Megabits, leaving 12 Megabits in the token bucket. Since the computer can transmit at a rate of 10 Mbps, it can use up the remaining 12 Megabits in 1.2 seconds, not 2 seconds.
Wrong answer: C) 5 seconds
Why Incorrect: This is incorrect because the token bucket is initially filled to capacity with 16 Megabits and it is filled at a rate of 2 Mbps. In 5 seconds, 2 Mbps will fill the token bucket with 10 Megabits, leaving 6 Megabits in the token bucket. Since the computer can transmit at a rate of 10 Mbps, it can use up the remaining 6 Megabits in 0.6 seconds, not 5 seconds.
Wrong answer: D) 8 seconds
Why Incorrect: This is incorrect because the token bucket is initially filled to capacity with 16 Megabits and it is filled at a rate of 2 Mbps. In 8 seconds, 2 Mbps will fill the token bucket with 16 Megabits, leaving no Megabits in the token bucket. Since the computer can transmit at a rate of 10 Mbps, it cannot use up the remaining 0 Megabits in 8 seconds.

"In the slow start phase of the TCP congestion control algorithm, the size of the congestion window

A) does not increase
B) increases linearly
C) increases quadratically
D) increases exponentially",D) increases exponentially,"Correct answer:
B) increases linearly
Explanation:
The question is about the way in which the size of the congestion window increases during the slow start phase of TCP's congestion control algorithm.
The explanation to the correct answer is: During the slow start phase, the size of the congestion window increases linearly, doubling with each acknowledgment of a successful data transfer. This linear growth ensures that the network is not overwhelmed by data packets, which can lead to packet loss and congestion.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) does not increase
Why Incorrect: During the slow start phase, the size of the congestion window does indeed increase. It starts from an initial value and then doubles with each acknowledgment of successful data transfer.
Wrong answer: C) increases quadratically
Why Incorrect: Quadratic growth would be too aggressive and could lead to network congestion quickly. TCP uses a linear increase during the slow start phase to ensure a gradual increase in the amount of data being sent.
Wrong answer: D) increases exponentially
Why Incorrect: Exponential growth is too aggressive and can lead to rapid increases in the size of the congestion window, potentially causing network congestion. TCP uses a linear increase during the slow start phase to ensure a gradual increase in the amount of data being sent.

"Consider an instance of TCP’s Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) algorithm where the window size at the start of the slow start phase is 2 MSS and the threshold at the start of the first transmission is 8 MSS. Assume that a time-out occurs during the fifth transmission. Find the congestion window size at the end of the tenth transmission.

A) 8 MSS
B) 14 MSS
C) 7 MSS
D) 12 MSS",C) 7 MSS,"Correct answer:
D) 12 MSS
Explanation:
This question is about the TCP AIMD algorithm and how it handles timeouts during its operation. TCP uses AIMD to dynamically adjust the window size to manage congestion and maintain a stable data transfer rate. When a timeout occurs, the algorithm reduces the window size multiplicatively to half its current value.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is D) 12 MSS. The AIMD algorithm will reduce the window size from 14 MSS to 7 MSS when a timeout occurs. However, the window size is increased by 1 MSS during each transmission that does not result in a timeout. Thus, at the end of the tenth transmission, the window size will be 12 MSS.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) 8 MSS
        Why Incorrect: This is the threshold value at the start of the first transmission. After a timeout, the window size would be reduced from 14 MSS to 7 MSS, not 8 MSS.
Wrong answer: B) 14 MSS
        Why Incorrect: This is the initial window size at the start of the slow start phase. After a timeout, the window size is reduced to half its current value, which is 7 MSS, not 14 MSS.
Wrong answer: C) 7 MSS
        Why Incorrect: This is the window size after a timeout during the fifth transmission. The window size is then increased by 1 MSS during each subsequent transmission, not decreased.

"Consider the store-and-forward packet-switched network given below. Assume that the bandwidth of each link is 10⁶ bytes/sec. A user on host A sends a file of size 10³ bytes to host B through routers R1 and R2 in three different ways. In the first case, a single packet containing the complete file is transmitted from A to B. In the second case, the file is split into 10 equal parts, and these packets are transmitted from A to B. In the third case, the file is split into 20 equal parts and these packets are sent from A to B. Each packet contains 100 bytes of header information along with the user data. Consider only transmission time and ignore processing, queuing and propagation delays. Also assume that there are no errors during transmission.

B) T1 > T2 > T3
C) T2 = T3, T3 < T1
D) T1 = T3, T3 > T2","D) T1 = T3, T3 > T2","Correct answer:
C) T2 = T3, T3 < T1
Explanation:
The question is about the time taken to transmit a file of size 10³ bytes in a store-and-forward packet-switched network with three different transmission methods.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is C) T2 = T3, T3 < T1. This is because when the file is split into 10 equal parts, each part is 1000 bytes long, and when the file is split into 20 equal parts, each part is 500 bytes long. In both cases, the time taken for transmission is the same, as each part takes the same time to be transmitted. However, when the file is sent as a single packet, the transmission time is more because the header information is also included in the packet, making it larger.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) T1 < T2 < T3
        Why Incorrect: This sequence is incorrect because the transmission time for a single packet is longer than that for multiple packets due to the inclusion of header information in the single packet.
Wrong answer: B) T1 > T2 > T3
        Why Incorrect: This sequence is incorrect because the transmission time for a single packet is longer than that for multiple packets due to the inclusion of header information in the single packet.

"Consider a simplified time-slotted MAC protocol, where each host always has data to send and transmits with probability p = 0.2 in every slot. There is no backoff, and one frame can be transmitted in one slot. If more than one host transmits in the same slot, then the transmissions are unsuccessful due to collision. What is the maximum number of hosts which this protocol can support, if each host has to be provided a minimum throughput of 0.16 frames per time slot?

A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4",B) 2,"Correct answer:
D) 4
Explanation:
The question is about the maximum number of hosts a simple time-slotted MAC protocol can support, given a minimum throughput requirement for each host.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is 4. With a transmission probability of p = 0.2, the protocol can support up to 4 hosts, each transmitting with a minimum throughput of 0.16 frames per time slot. This is because, with 4 hosts, each host will have a 0.16 probability of transmitting in a given time slot, and the total probability of any two hosts transmitting simultaneously is less than 0.2, which is the probability of a collision.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) 1
        Why Incorrect: With only one host, there is no need for a MAC protocol because the host can always transmit without collision. Hence, 1 is not the maximum number of hosts this protocol can support.
Wrong answer: B) 2
        Why Incorrect: With only two hosts, the probability of collision is higher than 0.2, as both hosts will transmit with a probability of 0.16 each, which adds up to 0.32, exceeding the collision threshold of 0.2.
Wrong answer: C) 3
        Why Incorrect: With three hosts, the probability of collision is higher than 0.2, as two hosts can transmit simultaneously with a probability of 0.16 each, which adds up to 0.32, exceeding the collision threshold of 0.2.

"A sender uses the Stop-and-Wait ARQ protocol for reliable transmission of frames. Frames are of size 1000 bytes and the transmission rate at the sender is 80 Kbps (1 Kbps = 1000 bits/second). The size of an acknowledgement is 100 bytes and the transmission rate at the receiver is 8 Kbps. The one-way propagation delay is 100 milliseconds.

Assuming no frame is lost, the sender throughput is __________ bytes/second.

A) 2500
B) 2000
C) 1500
D) 500
",A) 2500,"Explanation:
The question asks for the sender throughput when the Stop-and-Wait ARQ protocol is used for reliable transmission of frames.
The sender throughput is the amount of data that the sender can transmit in a second. In this case, the sender throughput depends on the frame size, the transmission rate at the sender, the size of an acknowledgement, and the transmission rate at the receiver.
The sender throughput is calculated using the formula: Sender throughput = (Frame size + Ack size) x Transmission rate at the sender / (Transmission rate at the receiver + Propagation delay).
The propagation delay is given as 100 milliseconds, so we can plug in the values to get the sender throughput as: 2500 bytes/second.

The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is A) 2500 bytes/second. This is because the frame size is 1000 bytes, the acknowledgement size is 100 bytes, the transmission rate at the sender is 80 Kbps, and the transmission rate at the receiver is 8 Kbps. Therefore, the sender throughput is (1000 + 100) x 80,000 / (8,000 + 100) = 2500 bytes/second.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: B) 2000 bytes/second
    Why Incorrect: This answer is incorrect because the sender throughput is not 2000 bytes/second. It is actually 2500 bytes/second.
Wrong answer: C) 1500 bytes/second
    Why Incorrect: This answer is incorrect because the sender throughput is not 1500 bytes/second. It is actually 2500 bytes/second.
Wrong answer: D) 500 bytes/second
    Why Incorrect: This answer is incorrect because the sender throughput is not 500 bytes/second. It is actually 2500 bytes/second.

"A firewall is to be configured to allow hosts in a private network to freely open TCP connections and send packets on open connections. However, it will only allow external hosts to send packets on existing open TCP connections or connections that are being opened (by internal hosts) but not allow them to open TCP connections to hosts in the private network. To achieve this, the minimum capability of the firewall should be that of:

A) A combinational circuit
B) A finite automaton
C) A pushdown automaton with one stack
D) A pushdown automaton with two stacks",D) A pushdown automaton with two stacks,"Correct answer:

"In a network virtualization environment using NFV (Network Functions Virtualization) and SDN (Software-Defined Networking), a newly deployed intrusion detection engine inspects encapsulated traffic (VXLAN, GRE) at scale. Which challenge is most likely to degrade the engine’s effectiveness?

A) The engine’s inability to parse IPv6 extension headers
B) Excessive VLAN tag rewriting at the hypervisor layer
C) Frequent changes in the encapsulation header fields that obfuscate payload inspection
D) Strict rate limiting on the control plane traffic between SDN controller and NFV orchestrator",C) Frequent changes in the encapsulation header fields that obfuscate payload inspection,"Correct answer:
C) Frequent changes in the encapsulation header fields that obfuscate payload inspection
Explanation:
Let me rephrase and expand the question for better understanding: When an intrusion detection engine must inspect encapsulated traffic, such as VXLAN or GRE, at scale within an NFV and SDN environment, what challenge might hinder its effectiveness?
The explanation to the correct answer is: Analyze the correct answer: The frequent changes in the encapsulation header fields, especially when encapsulation types are dynamic or when the encapsulation headers are modified for routing purposes, can obfuscate the payload inspection by the intrusion detection engine. This is because the engine may not be able to accurately identify and interpret the encapsulation headers, making it difficult to correctly parse the payload for analysis.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) The engine's inability to parse IPv6 extension headers
Why Incorrect: While an engine's inability to parse IPv6 extension headers could be a limitation, the question specifically addresses the challenge of inspecting encapsulated traffic at scale, not the specific parsing capabilities of the engine.
Wrong answer: B) Excessive VLAN tag rewriting at the hypervisor layer
Why Incorrect: VLAN tag rewriting at the hypervisor layer is not a challenge related to payload inspection but rather a potential performance bottleneck in the virtual networking infrastructure.
Wrong answer: D) Strict rate limiting on the control plane traffic between SDN controller and NFV orchestrator
Why Incorrect: Strict rate limiting on control plane traffic would impact the speed and efficiency of network management but would not directly impact the payload inspection capabilities of the intrusion detection engine.

How many total number of IP fragments will be transmitted and what will be the contents of the offset field in the last fragment?

A) 6 and 925
B) 6 and 7400
C) 7 and 1110
D) 7 and 8880",C) 7 and 1110,"Correct answer:
B) 6 and 7400
Explanation:
The question asks us to determine the number of IP fragments that will be transmitted when a large UDP datagram is sent over an Ethernet LAN, and what the offset field in the last fragment will contain.
The explanation to the correct answer is: When a large UDP datagram is sent over an Ethernet LAN, it is broken into fragments to fit within the Ethernet frame size (MTU = 1500 bytes). The first fragment contains the IP header (20 bytes), UDP header (8 bytes), and the first 1500 - 20 - 8 = 1472 bytes of user data. This fragment is transmitted with the offset field set to 0. The second fragment contains the remaining 1472 bytes of user data and is transmitted with the offset field set to 1472. The third fragment contains the next 1472 bytes of user data and is transmitted with the offset field set to 2944. This process continues until all the user data has been transmitted, resulting in a total of six fragments. The last fragment contains the remaining 8880 - 7400 = 1480 bytes of user data and is transmitted with the offset field set to 7400. Therefore, the correct answer is B) 6 and 7400.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) 6 and 925
        Why Incorrect: The offset field in the last fragment should not be 925, as this is not the correct value for the offset field. The correct value is 7400, as explained above.
Wrong answer: C) 7 and 1110
        Why Incorrect: The correct number of fragments is 6, not 7. The offset field in the last fragment should be 7400, not 1110.
Wrong answer: D) 7 and 8880
        Why Incorrect: The correct number of fragments is 6, not 7. The offset field in the last fragment should be 7400, not 8880.

Since there are 8 bits per pixel and 8 bits are allocated for each of the R, G, B components, the total size of the lookup table would be 8 * 8 * 8 = 512 bits. This is equivalent to 64 bytes, but considering the 8-bit alignment, the size of the lookup table is 256 bytes.

(3) Step_Three: Lets analyze why the other answers are incorrect:
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) 24 bytes
        Why Incorrect: This is the size of a pixel in the frame buffer, not the lookup table.
Wrong answer: B) 1024 bytes
        Why Incorrect: This is too large. The size of the lookup table is based on the number of bits per pixel and the number of bits allocated for each component, not the total number of pixels in the frame buffer.
Wrong answer: C) 768 bytes
        Why Incorrect: This is too large. The size of the lookup table is based on the number of bits per pixel and the number of bits allocated for each component, not the total number of pixels in the frame buffer.

"Which one of the following is used to compute cyclomatic complexity?

A) The number of regions – 1
B) E – N + 1, where E is the number of flow graph edges and N is the number of flow graph nodes
C) P – 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G
D) P + 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G","D) P + 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G","Correct answer:
B) E – N + 1, where E is the number of flow graph edges and N is the number of flow graph nodes
Explanation:
The question is asking about the formula used to compute the cyclomatic complexity of a flow graph. Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the structural complexity of a program, specifically, the number of linearly independent paths through the program.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is B) E – N + 1, where E is the number of flow graph edges and N is the number of flow graph nodes. This formula is used to calculate the cyclomatic complexity of a flow graph.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) The number of regions – 1
        Why Incorrect: This is incorrect because the cyclomatic complexity is not calculated by the number of regions – 1. The number of regions is not used in the calculation of cyclomatic complexity.
Wrong answer: C) P – 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G
        Why Incorrect: This is incorrect because the cyclomatic complexity is not calculated by P – 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G. The number of predicate nodes is not used in the calculation of cyclomatic complexity.
Wrong answer: D) P + 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G
        Why Incorrect: This is incorrect because the cyclomatic complexity is not calculated by P + 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G. The number of predicate nodes is not used in the calculation of cyclomatic complexity.
