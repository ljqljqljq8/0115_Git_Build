"Consider a network using the pure ALOHA medium access control protocol, where each frame is of length 1,000 bits. The channel transmission rate is 1 Mbps (=10⁶ bits per second). The aggregate number of transmissions across all the nodes (including new frame transmissions and retransmitted frames due to collisions) is modelled as a Poisson process with a rate of 1,000 frames per second. Throughput is defined as the average number of frames successfully transmitted per second. The throughput of the network (rounded to the nearest integer) is ______________ .

A) 130 to 140
B) 140 to 150
C) 120 to 130
D) 100 to 110",A) 130 to 140,"orrect answer:
B) 140 to 150
Explanation:
The question asks to calculate the throughput of a network using the pure ALOHA protocol, where the aggregate number of transmissions is modelled as a Poisson process.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is 140 to 150. The throughput of a network using pure ALOHA protocol is equal to the probability that a frame is transmitted without collision. The probability of no collision is equal to the probability that there are no other frames transmitted during the frame duration. This probability is given by the Erlang B formula. The Erlang B formula for this case is 1 - (1 - 0.001)⁰.999 = 0.999999, which means that the throughput is approximately 1 - 0.999999 = 0.000001 or 0.0001% of the total frames transmitted. Since the rate of transmission is 1000 frames per second, the throughput is 1 frame per second, which is approximately 140 to 150 frames per second.

"Consider a link with packet loss probability of 0.2. What is the expected number of transmissions it would take to transfer 200 packets given that the stop and wait protocol is used?

A) 125
B) 250
C) 225
D) 150",B) 250,"Correct answer:
D) 150
Explanation:
The question is asking for the expected number of transmissions required to send 200 packets over a link with a packet loss probability of 0.2 when using the stop and wait protocol.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is 150. The stop and wait protocol requires each packet to be acknowledged before the next packet is sent. Therefore, for each packet sent, there is a 20% chance of losing the acknowledgement and needing to resend the packet. The expected number of transmissions per packet is 1 + 0.2 = 1.2. Thus, for 200 packets, the expected number of transmissions is 200 x 1.2 = 240. However, since we're assuming that the link can only handle one packet at a time, we need to divide this by the number of packets that can be sent in parallel, which is 1 in this case, giving us 240 / 1 = 240.

(3) Step_Three: Let's review why the other answers are incorrect:
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) 125
        Why Incorrect: This number is less than the expected number of transmissions. It does not consider the probability of losing acknowledgements, which increases the number of transmissions needed.
Wrong answer: B) 250
        Why Incorrect: This number is more than the expected number of transmissions. It does not consider the fact that the link can only handle one packet at a time, which reduces the total number of transmissions needed.
Wrong answer: C) 225
        Why Incorrect: This number is not the correct answer as it does not consider the probability of losing acknowledgements, which increases the number of transmissions needed.

B) Network layer – 4 times, Data link layer – 6 times
C) Network layer – 2 times, Data link layer – 4 times
D) Network layer – 3 times, Data link layer – 4 times







","D) Network layer – 3 times, Data link layer – 4 times","Explanation:
The question is asking about the number of times a packet has to visit the network layer and data link layer during a transmission from a source to a destination, assuming an intermediate router.
The correct answer is: A) Network layer – 4 times, Data link layer – 4 times.
The correct answer is A. During a transmission from a source to a destination, a packet has to visit the network layer four times. The first visit is when the packet is generated, the second visit is when the packet is routed through the intermediate router, the third visit is when the packet is routed back to the destination, and the fourth visit is when the packet reaches the destination. Similarly, the packet has to visit the data link layer four times. The first visit is when the packet is generated, the second visit is when the packet is transmitted from the source to the intermediate router, the third visit is when the packet is transmitted from the intermediate router to the destination, and the fourth visit is when the packet reaches the destination.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: B) Network layer – 4 times, Data link layer – 6 times

B) C2 assumes C1 is on same network, but C1 assumes C2 is on a different network
Explanation:
The question is about the network assumptions made by two computers C1 and C2 based on their IP addresses and subnet masks.
The explanation to the correct answer is: Based on their IP addresses and subnet masks, C1 assumes that C2 is on a different network, but C2 assumes that C1 is on the same network. This is because C1's IP address falls outside the range of IP addresses that C2 considers to be on its network.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:

"Station A needs to send a message consisting of 9 packets to Station B using a sliding window (window size 3) and go-back-n error control strategy. All packets are ready and immediately available for transmission. If every 5th packet that A transmits gets lost (but no ACKs from B ever get lost), then what is the number of packets that A will transmit for sending the message to B?

A) 12
B) 14
C) 16
D) 18",C) 16,"Correct answer:
A) 12
Explanation:
The question asks for the number of packets that Station A will transmit in a sliding window (window size 3) and go-back-n error control strategy, when every 5th packet gets lost.
The explanation to the correct answer is: In the sliding window (window size 3) and go-back-n error control strategy, Station A will transmit 12 packets, as it sends 3 packets, then waits for the ACK of the first packet before sending the next 3 packets, and so on. In this scenario, every 5th packet gets lost, so 4 packets are lost in total. Therefore, A will send 12 packets in total.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: B) 14
        Why Incorrect: In the given scenario, Station A will transmit 12 packets, not 14. The number of packets to be transmitted is not directly related to the window size, but rather to the number of packets that get lost.
Wrong answer: C) 16
        Why Incorrect: The number of packets to be transmitted is not 16. In the given scenario, every 5th packet gets lost, so 4 packets are lost in total. Therefore, A will send 12 packets in total.
Wrong answer: D) 18
        Why Incorrect: The number of packets to be transmitted is not 18. In the given scenario, every 5th packet gets lost, so 4 packets are lost in total. Therefore, A will send 12 packets in total.

"In a network of LANs connected by bridges, packets are sent from one LAN to another through intermediate bridges. Since more than one path may exist between two LANs, packets may have to be routed through multiple bridges. Why is the spanning tree algorithm used for bridge-routing?

A) For shortest path routing between LANs
B) For avoiding loops in the routing paths
C) For fault tolerance
D) For minimizing collisions
",B) For avoiding loops in the routing paths,"Correct answer:
B) For avoiding loops in the routing paths
Explanation:
This question is about the purpose of the spanning tree algorithm in bridge routing. In a network of LANs connected by bridges, packets can be sent from one LAN to another through multiple bridges. The spanning tree algorithm is used to ensure that there are no loops in the routing paths.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is B) For avoiding loops in the routing paths. The spanning tree algorithm is used to find a loop-free path between LANs, ensuring that packets are routed efficiently without the risk of looping back on themselves.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) For shortest path routing between LANs
        Why Incorrect: While the spanning tree algorithm does create a loop-free path, it does not necessarily ensure the shortest path between LANs. The shortest path may not be the most reliable or efficient in a network with multiple potential paths.
Wrong answer: C) For fault tolerance
        Why Incorrect: While the spanning tree algorithm does provide a degree of fault tolerance by creating a loop-free path, it is not specifically designed for fault tolerance. Fault tolerance is a broader concept that includes redundancy and failover mechanisms.
Wrong answer: D) For minimizing collisions
        Why Incorrect: The spanning tree algorithm does not directly address collision avoidance. Collision avoidance is typically achieved through MAC-level protocols like CSMA/CD or CSMA/CA, which are not directly influenced by the spanning tree algorithm.

Consider the following situation: the server process S executes a socket(), a bind() and a listen() system call in that order, following which it is preempted. Subsequently, the client process P executes a socket() system call followed by connect() system call to connect to the server process S. The server process has not executed any accept() system call. Which one of the following events could take place?

A) connect() system call returns successfully
B) connect() system call blocks
C) connect() system call returns an error
D) connect() system call results in a core dump
",C) connect() system call returns an error,"Explanation:
The question is asking about the possible outcomes of the TCP connection process when a client process attempts to connect to a server process that has not yet executed the accept() system call.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is A) connect() system call returns successfully. This is because the client process's connect() system call will return successfully even if the server process has not yet executed the accept() system call. The client process will not be aware that the server process has not executed the accept() system call until it receives an error message from the server process.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: B) connect() system call blocks
    Why Incorrect: The connect() system call does not block. It either returns successfully or returns an error. If it returns an error, the client process knows that it cannot establish a connection with the server process.
Wrong answer: C) connect() system call returns an error
    Why Incorrect: The connect() system call does not return an error. It either returns successfully or returns an error. If it returns an error, the client process knows that it cannot establish a connection with the server process.
Wrong answer: D) connect() system call results in a core dump
    Why Incorrect: A core dump is a result of a program crash or segmentation fault. In the scenario described in the question, the connect() system call does not result in a core dump. It either returns successfully or returns an error.

"The CPU of a system having 1 MIPS execution rate needs 4 machine cycles on average for executing an instruction. Fifty percent of the cycles use the memory bus. A memory read/write employs one machine cycle. For execution of the programs, the system utilizes 90 percent of the CPU time. For block data transfer, an I/O device is attached to the system while the CPU executes the background programs continuously. What is the maximum I/O data transfer rate if programmed I/O data transfer technique is used?

A) 500 Kbytes/sec
B) 2.2 Mbytes/sec
C) 125 Kbytes/sec
D) 250 Kbytes/sec",D) 250 Kbytes/sec,"Correct answer:
A) 500 Kbytes/sec
Explanation:
The question is about the maximum I/O data transfer rate in a system using the programmed I/O technique. It's important to understand the concept of programmed I/O technique, where the CPU has to be involved in every I/O operation, and how this impacts the maximum data transfer rate.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is A) 500 Kbytes/sec. This is calculated by taking into account the CPU execution rate (1 MIPS), the average number of machine cycles for instruction execution (4), the utilization of memory bus (50%), the memory read/write cycle (1), the CPU execution time (90%), and the I/O data transfer rate (250 Kbytes/sec). The formula for calculating the maximum I/O data transfer rate using the programmed I/O technique is: Maximum I/O Data Transfer Rate = (CPU Execution Rate * 90% * (1 - 50% / 4)) * (1 / (1 + 1)) * 250 Kbytes/sec = 500 Kbytes/sec.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: B) 2.2 Mbytes/sec
        Why Incorrect: This value is incorrect because it's higher than the maximum I/O data transfer rate, which is 500 Kbytes/sec. The formula used to calculate this value doesn't account for the CPU execution rate and the other factors mentioned above.
Wrong answer: C) 125 Kbytes/sec
        Why Incorrect: This value is incorrect because it's lower than the maximum I/O data transfer rate, which is 500 Kbytes/sec. The formula used to calculate this value doesn't account for the CPU execution rate and the other factors mentioned above.
Wrong answer: D) 250 Kbytes/sec
        Why Incorrect: This value is incorrect because it's lower than the maximum I/O data transfer rate, which is 500 Kbytes/sec. The formula used to calculate this value doesn't account for the CPU execution rate and the other factors mentioned above.

To achieve this, the ISP can use two CIDR blocks. One block can be allocated to Organization A with half the IP addresses, and the other block can be allocated to Organization B with a quarter of the IP addresses. Since half of the IP addresses are 10, and a quarter of the IP addresses are 5, the ISP can allocate the following CIDR blocks to the organizations:
Organization A: 245.248.128.0/21 (2^10 addresses)
Organization B: 245.248.128.0/22 (2^5 addresses)
The remaining quarter of the IP addresses (2^5 addresses) are retained by the ISP.

A) 8 MSS
B) 14 MSS
C) 7 MSS
D) 12 MSS",C) 7 MSS,"Correct answer:
B) 14 MSS
Explanation:
This question is testing your understanding of TCP’s Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) algorithm and its behavior in the face of time-outs during the slow start phase.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is B) 14 MSS. The AIMD algorithm dictates that the congestion window size should be increased by one MSS (2 MSS in this case) after each successful transmission. After a time-out, the congestion window size is set to one-half of the threshold (4 MSS in this case), and then the slow start phase continues. After the fifth transmission, the congestion window size becomes 8 MSS. With each successful transmission, the window size increases by one MSS, leading to a total of 14 MSS at the end of the tenth transmission.

"Consider the store-and-forward packet-switched network given below. Assume that the bandwidth of each link is 10⁶ bytes/sec. A user on host A sends a file of size 10³ bytes to host B through routers R1 and R2 in three different ways. In the first case, a single packet containing the complete file is transmitted from A to B. In the second case, the file is split into 10 equal parts, and these packets are transmitted from A to B. In the third case, the file is split into 20 equal parts and these packets are sent from A to B. Each packet contains 100 bytes of header information along with the user data. Consider only transmission time and ignore processing, queuing and propagation delays. Also assume that there are no errors during transmission. Let T1, T2, and T3 be the times taken to transmit the file in the first, second, and third case respectively.

A) T1 < T2 < T3
B) T1 > T2 > T3
C) T2 = T3, T3 < T1
D) T1 = T3, T3 > T2","D) T1 = T3, T3 > T2","Correct answer:
A) T1 < T2 < T3
Explanation:
The question is asking about the transmission times in three different scenarios for sending a file of size 10³ bytes from host A to host B through routers R1 and R2 in a store-and-forward packet-switched network. The bandwidth of each link is 10⁶ bytes/sec, and each packet contains 100 bytes of header information along with the user data.
The correct answer is A) T1 < T2 < T3.
This is because when a single packet containing the complete file is transmitted from A to B, it takes the least time, i.e., T1. When the file is split into 10 equal parts, and these packets are transmitted from A to B, the transmission time is more than T1 but less than T3, i.e., T2. Similarly, when the file is split into 20 equal parts and these packets are sent from A to B, the transmission time is more than T2, i.e., T3.
The other options are incorrect because they do not follow the correct order of transmission times based on the number of packets. For example, option B suggests that the transmission time for sending the file in one packet (T1) is greater than the transmission time for sending the file in 10 packets (T2) which is incorrect. Similarly, option D suggests that the transmission time for sending the file in one packet (T1) is equal to the transmission time for sending the file in 20 packets (T3) which is also incorrect.

Explanation:
The question asks about the maximum achievable throughput in a communication scenario where host A sends data to host B over a full duplex link using the sliding window protocol. The send and receive window sizes are given, as are the data packet size and transmission time, and the propagation delay.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is C) 12.33 × 10⁶ bytes per second. To calculate this, we use the formula for throughput: T = (R × W) / (2 × T + 2 × P), where T is throughput, R is the data rate, W is the window size, T is the transmission time, and P is the propagation delay. In this case, R = 20 × 10⁶ bytes per second, W = 5 packets, T = 50 μs, and P = 200 μs. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: T = (20 × 10⁶ × 5) / (2 × 50 + 2 × 200) = 12.33 × 10⁶ bytes per second.

A) 160
B) 320
C) 640
D) 220",B) 320,"Correct answer:
D) 220
Explanation:
This question asks for the minimum frame size in bytes to achieve a link utilization of at least 50% in the stop-and-wait protocol on a link with a specific bit rate and propagation delay.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is D) 220. The formula for the minimum frame size to achieve a utilization of at least 50% in the stop-and-wait protocol is given by: Minimum Frame Size (in bytes) = (Bit Rate (in bits per second) x Propagation Delay (in seconds)) / 2. In this case, we have a bit rate of 64 kilobits per second (64 x 10^3 bits per second) and a propagation delay of 20 milliseconds (0.02 seconds). Therefore, the minimum frame size is calculated as: Minimum Frame Size (in bytes) = (64 x 10^3 bits per second x 0.02 seconds) / 2 = 640 bytes. However, since the frame size must be an integer number of bytes, the minimum frame size to achieve a utilization of at least 50% is rounded up to the nearest integer, which is 220 bytes.

The size of an acknowledgement is 100 bytes and the transmission rate at the receiver is 8 Kbps. The one-way propagation delay is 100 milliseconds.

Assuming no frame is lost, the sender throughput is __________ bytes/second.

A) 2500
B) 2000
C) 1500
D) 500
",A) 2500,"Explanation:
The question asks about the sender throughput when using the Stop-and-Wait ARQ protocol for reliable transmission of frames. The sender throughput is the rate at which the sender can successfully transmit frames to the receiver.
The correct answer is A) 2500 bytes/second. The sender throughput is calculated as the frame size (1000 bytes) multiplied by the transmission rate at the sender (80 Kbps) divided by the acknowledgement size (100 bytes). This gives us 2500 bytes/second.

"A firewall is to be configured to allow hosts in a private network to freely open TCP connections and send packets on open connections. However, it will only allow external hosts to send packets on existing open TCP connections or connections that are being opened (by internal hosts) but not allow them to open TCP connections to hosts in the private network. To achieve this, the minimum capability of the firewall should be that of:

A) A combinational circuit
B) A finite automaton
C) A pushdown automaton with one stack
D) A pushdown automaton with two stacks",D) A pushdown automaton with two stacks,"Correct answer:
B) A finite automaton
Explanation:
The question is asking for the minimum capability of a firewall that can allow hosts in a private network to freely open TCP connections and send packets on open connections, while only allowing external hosts to send packets on existing open TCP connections or connections that are being opened (by internal hosts) but not allow them to open TCP connections to hosts in the private network.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is B) A finite automaton. A finite automaton can recognize patterns in a sequence of inputs and make decisions based on those patterns. In the context of a firewall, it can be programmed to allow or deny specific types of network traffic based on predefined rules or patterns.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) A combinational circuit
        Why Incorrect: A combinational circuit is a type of digital circuit that outputs a value based solely on the current state of its inputs. While it can perform logical operations, it does not have the ability to remember past states or make decisions based on a sequence of inputs, which is required for a firewall to operate.
Wrong answer: C) A pushdown automaton with one stack
        Why Incorrect: A pushdown automaton with one stack is a type of automaton that can perform operations on a stack of symbols. While this type of automaton can process input sequences in a specific order, it does not have the ability to make decisions based on predefined rules, which is crucial for a firewall.
Wrong answer: D) A pushdown automaton with two stacks

This question is asking about the most critical bottleneck that needs to be addressed in a cryptographic protocol for real-time communication, which combines elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange with advanced homomorphic encryption.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is A) The ephemeral key generation time for elliptic-curve keys. The generation of ephemeral keys is critical in real-time communication, as it determines the time it takes to establish a secure session. In the proposed protocol, the use of elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange can potentially reduce this time, making it more suitable for real-time communication.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: B) The complexity of group operations in the homomorphic domain leading to high computational overhead
        Why Incorrect: The complexity of group operations in the homomorphic domain is a concern, but it's not the most critical bottleneck in the proposed protocol. The key challenge is to reduce the time required for ephemeral key generation.
Wrong answer: C) The upper bound on the public key size for elliptic-curve systems
        Why Incorrect: While the size of the public key is a concern in cryptographic systems, it is not the most critical bottleneck in the proposed protocol. The key challenge is to reduce the time required for ephemeral key generation.
Wrong answer: D) The necessity to store session keys indefinitely to maintain homomorphism

The question asks for the minimum time required to transmit a certain amount of data, assuming the token bucket algorithm is used for congestion control.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is A) 1.1 seconds. The token bucket is currently full, so it can send data at the maximum output rate of 20 megabytes per second. The 12 megabytes of data need to be sent, which is 0.6 seconds at the maximum rate. Since the token bucket can only sustain a rate of 10 megabytes per second, the remaining 0.6 seconds must be sent at a rate of 10 megabytes per second, which takes 0.1 seconds. The total time is 0.6 seconds + 0.1 seconds = 0.7 seconds. Since we need to round up to the nearest tenth of a second, the answer is 1.1 seconds.

D) to synchronize receiver for receiving the last byte",A) to synchronize receiver for receiving every byte,"Correct answer:
A) to synchronize receiver for receiving every byte
Explanation:
The question is asking about the purpose of a start bit in the RS-232 serial communication protocol. A start bit is an important part of the protocol that helps to synchronize the receiver and ensure it is ready to receive a byte of data.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is ""to synchronize receiver for receiving every byte"". A start bit is sent at the beginning of every byte of data in RS-232 serial communication. It's a binary 0, which the receiver detects as a transition from the idle state (high voltage) to the active state (low voltage). This transition synchronizes the receiver and ensures it is ready to receive the data that follows.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: B) to synchronize receiver for receiving a sequence of bytes
    Why Incorrect: This is incorrect because the start bit is sent at the beginning of every byte of data, not just for a sequence of bytes.

D) 256 bytes",D) 256 bytes,"Correct answer:
D) 256 bytes
Explanation:
The question is asking about the size of the lookup table when the frame buffer has a certain number of bits per pixel and each color component is allocated a specific number of bits.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is D) 256 bytes. This is because the lookup table has 256 entries, each corresponding to a unique color value. With 8 bits per pixel and 8 bits for each R, G, and B component, the total size of the lookup table would be 256 bytes (8 bits * 256 entries = 2048 bits, which is 256 bytes).
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) 24 bytes
        Why Incorrect: This is incorrect because the size of the lookup table is not directly proportional to the number of pixels in the frame buffer. The lookup table is used to map colors to pixel values, and its size is determined by the number of unique color values it needs to store, not the number of pixels.

        Why Incorrect: This is incorrect because the size of the lookup table is not determined by the number of pixels in the frame buffer. The lookup table is used to map colors to pixel values, and its size is determined by the number of unique color values it needs to store, not the number of pixels.
Wrong answer: C) 768 bytes
        Why Incorrect: This is incorrect because the size of the lookup table is not directly proportional to the number of pixels in the frame buffer. The lookup table is used to map colors to pixel values, and its size is determined by the number of unique color values it needs to store, not the number of pixels.

"Which one of the following is used to compute cyclomatic complexity?

A) The number of regions – 1
B) E – N + 1, where E is the number of flow graph edges and N is the number of flow graph nodes
C) P – 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G
D) P + 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G","D) P + 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G","Correct answer:
B) E – N + 1, where E is the number of flow graph edges and N is the number of flow graph nodes
Explanation:
The question is asking which formula is used to compute the cyclomatic complexity of a flow graph in software engineering.
The explanation to the correct answer is: The correct answer is ""E – N + 1, where E is the number of flow graph edges and N is the number of flow graph nodes."" This formula is used to calculate the cyclomatic complexity, which measures the complexity of a flow graph by counting the number of decision points (or predicate nodes) in the graph.
The explanation to other wrong answers are:
Wrong answer: A) The number of regions – 1
        Why Incorrect: This is incorrect because cyclomatic complexity is not related to the number of regions in a flow graph. The cyclomatic complexity is calculated based on the number of decision points in the graph.
Wrong answer: C) P – 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G
        Why Incorrect: This is incorrect because cyclomatic complexity is not calculated by subtracting 1 from the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph. Instead, it is calculated by adding 1 to the difference between the number of flow graph edges and the number of flow graph nodes.
Wrong answer: D) P + 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G
        Why Incorrect: This is incorrect because cyclomatic complexity is not calculated by adding 1 to the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph. Instead, it is calculated by adding 1 to the difference between the number of flow graph edges and the number of flow graph nodes.
