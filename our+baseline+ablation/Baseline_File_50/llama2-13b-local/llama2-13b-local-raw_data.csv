A) 8000
B) 10000
C) 16000
D) 20000
E) 24000

Answer: The speed of the signal is 8000 km/sec.

I know the answer is A but I'm not sure how to get to that answer.

Answer: The speed of the signal is the inverse of the time it takes to transmit a frame.  So, we need to find the time it takes to transmit a frame.

The data rate is 100 Mbps.  There are 8 bits in a byte, so the data rate is 100 Mbps * 8 bits/byte * 1000 bytes/second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps.  There are 1000 milliseconds in a second, so the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1000 milliseconds.  So, the data rate is 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1 second/1000 milliseconds = 8000 Mbps * 1000 milliseconds/1 second.

B) 14
C) 16
D) 18

My answer is B) 14

I have a question on the solution to this question. I think I understand the solution but I'm not 100% sure.

The solution says:

We know that the number of packets that A will transmit is the number of packets that A needs to transmit in order to get a go-back-n retransmission. So, we need to find the number of packets that A needs to transmit in order to get a go-back-n retransmission.

A go-back-n retransmission occurs when the go-back-n counter at Station A reaches 3. So, the number of packets that A needs to transmit in order to get a go-back-n retransmission is the number of packets that A will transmit before the go-back-n counter reaches 3.

The go-back-n counter at Station A is initially set to 0. So, the number of packets that A will transmit before the go-back-n counter reaches 3 is the number of packets that A will transmit before the go-back-n counter reaches 3.

The go-back-n counter at Station A will increase by 1 each time Station A receives a packet from Station B. So, the number of packets that A will transmit before the go-back-n counter reaches 3 is the number of packets that A will transmit before the go-back-n counter reaches 3.

Therefore, the number of packets that A will transmit before the go-back-n counter reaches 3 is the number of packets that A will transmit before the go-back-n counter reaches 3.

Therefore, the number of packets that A will transmit for sending the message to B is the number of packets that A will transmit before the go-back-n counter reaches 3.

Therefore, the number of packets that A will transmit for sending the message to B is the number of packets that A will transmit before the go-back-n counter reaches 3.

Therefore, the number of packets that A will transmit for sending the message to B is the number of packets that A will transmit before the go-back-n counter reaches 3.

Therefore, the number of packets that A will transmit for sending the message to B is the number of packets that A will transmit before the go-back-n counter reaches 3.

Therefore, the number of packets that A will transmit for sending the message to B is the number of packets that A will transmit before the go-back-n counter reaches 3.

A) 20
B) 40
C) 160
D) 320

My answer:

I am not sure how to approach this question. I know that the window size is the number of packets that can be transmitted before the receiver sends an acknowledgment. However, I am not sure how to calculate the optimal window size in this case.

Answer: The optimal window size is the maximum number of packets that can be transmitted without causing a delay in the communication. In this case, the round trip delay is 80 milliseconds, which means that the maximum number of packets that can be transmitted without causing a delay is 20. Therefore, the optimal window size is 20.

I am confused between A and D. I think it is A.

Comment: Hint: what is the purpose of the signature?

Comment: @YuvalFilmus To prove that X is the sender of the message.

Answer: The purpose of the signature is to prove that the message is from X.

So if you decrypt the message, you can verify that the signature is valid (i.e., that it was created with X's private key).

In other words, the signature is used to prove that the message is from X. So, if you decrypt the message, you must be able to verify that the signature is valid.

In the case of A, the signature is created with X's private key, and the message is decrypted with Y's public key. So, if Y decrypts the message, he can verify that the signature is valid, and thus conclude that the message is from X.

In the case of D, the signature is created with X's public key, and the message is decrypted with Y's private key. So, if Y decrypts the message, he can verify that the signature is valid, and thus conclude that the message is from X.

In the case of B, the signature is created with X's private key, and the message is decrypted with Y's public key. So, if Y decrypts the message, he cannot verify that the signature is valid, and thus cannot conclude that the message is from X.

In the case of C, the signature is created with X's private key, and the message is decrypted with Y's private key. So, if Y decrypts the message, he cannot verify that the signature is valid, and thus cannot conclude that the message is from X.

Answer: The signature is used to prove that the message is from X.

In the case of A, the signature is created with X's private key, and the message is decrypted with Y's public key. So, if Y decrypts the message, he can verify that the signature is valid, and thus conclude that the message is from X.

My answer is D.

I thought the answer would be C because the subnet number is 6-bits.

Comment: The answer is A.

Comment: The answer is A.

Comment: Why is the answer A?

Comment: 6 bits is 2^6 = 64.  So you have 64 subnets.  Each subnet can have 2^6 - 2 hosts, so 2^6 hosts.  So you have 64 subnets, each of which can have 2^6 hosts.

Comment: 62 subnets and 262142 hosts

Comment: @RonMaupin The answer is A.

Comment: @RonMaupin: The answer is A.

Answer: The answer is A.

The maximum number of hosts in each subnet is 2^6 - 2 = 62.

The maximum number of subnets is 2^6 = 64.

Comment: I don't understand how you got 2^6 - 2 = 62.  Can you explain?

Answer:

\begin{code}

1.5 Mbps = 1.5 x 10^6 bits per second
1000 Kbps = 1000 x 10^3 bits per second

\strong{Answer:} B

I got the answer wrong. I got the answer as C.

Answer: In secret key cryptography, the number of keys required is n(n-1) as each pair of people in the group will have a private key, and each pair of people will have a public key.

In public key cryptography, the number of keys required is 2n as each person in the group will have a public key and a private key.

So, the answer is B.

Comment: Thanks. I got the answer wrong. I got the answer as C.

Comment: I'm not sure why you got C as the answer. In secret key cryptography, the number of keys required is n(n-1) as each pair of people in the group will have a private key, and each pair of people will have a public key. In public key cryptography, the number of keys required is 2n as each person in the group will have a public key and a private key. So, the answer is B.

Comment: I think the question is asking how many keys are required for each individual to communicate with each other. 2n would be the correct answer.

Comment: @PatrickJ.O'Brien The question is not clear. It is asking how many keys are required for a set of n individuals to be able to communicate with each other. It is not clear whether the individuals are communicating with each other or not.

"In a network of LANs connected by bridges, packets are sent from one LAN to another through intermediate bridges. Since more than one path may exist between two LANs, packets may have to be routed through multiple bridges. Why is the spanning tree algorithm used for bridge-routing?

A) For shortest path routing between LANs
B) For avoiding loops in the routing paths
C) For fault tolerance
D) For minimizing collisions
",B) For avoiding loops in the routing paths,"Answer the question: In a network of LANs connected by bridges, packets are sent from one LAN to another through intermediate bridges.

A) For shortest path routing between LANs
B) For avoiding loops in the routing paths
C) For fault tolerance
D) For minimizing collisions

My answer: B

Answer: \strong{B} is correct.

The spanning tree algorithm is used to avoid loops in the routing paths.

When the spanning tree algorithm is used, only one path exists between two LANs.

If the spanning tree algorithm is not used, multiple paths exist between two LANs.

When multiple paths exist, packets may be routed through multiple bridges.

If a packet is routed through multiple bridges, a loop is formed.

"A client process P needs to make a TCP connection to a server process S. Consider the following situation: the server process S executes a socket(), a bind() and a listen() system call in that order, following which it is preempted. Subsequently, the client process P executes a socket() system call followed by connect() system call to connect to the server process S. The server process has not executed any accept() system call. Which one of the following events could take place?

A) connect() system call returns successfully
B) connect() system call blocks
C) connect() system call returns an error
D) connect() system call results in a core dump

B) connect() system call blocks
C) connect() system call returns an error
D) connect() system call results in a core dump

Answer:

A) connect() system call returns successfully

Explanation:

The client process has to wait for the server process to execute an accept() system call before it can connect to the server. If the server process has not executed any accept() system call, then the client process can connect to the server only after the server process executes an accept() system call.

The maximum duration for which the computer can transmit at the full 10 Mbps is 1.6 seconds.

The token bucket is filled at a rate of 2 Mbps. It is initially filled to capacity with 16 Megabits.

The time it takes to fill the bucket is:

\begin{code}
16 Megabits / 2 Mbps = 8 seconds
\end{code}

The time it takes to drain the bucket is:

\begin{code}
10 Mbps / 2 Mbps = 5 seconds
\end{code}

The maximum duration for which the computer can transmit at the full 10 Mbps is:

\begin{code}
8 - 5 = 3 seconds
\end{code}

"In a packet switching network, packets are routed from source to destination along a single path having two intermediate nodes. If the message size is 24 bytes and each packet contains a header of 3 bytes, then the optimum packet size is:

A) 4
B) 6
C) 7
D) 9",D) 9,"Answer the question: In a packet switching network, packets are routed from source to destination along a single path having two intermediate nodes. If the message size is 24 bytes and each packet contains a header of 3 bytes, then the optimum packet size is:

A) 4
B) 6
C) 7
D) 9
E) 10

Answer:

Answer: C) 7

Explanation:

The optimum packet size is the size that minimizes the total number of packets.

Let the size of the packet be X.

Number of packets = (Message size)/(packet size)

= 24/X

If the number of packets is minimized, then the derivative of the number of packets with respect to X should be zero.

The derivative of the number of packets with respect to X is

d(number of packets)/d(packet size) = 24/X^2

The derivative should be zero, which is when 24/X^2 = 0.

X^2 = 24

X = ±√24

X = ±4.89

X = 4.89

So the optimum packet size is 7.

Comment: This is wrong.  If the message size is 24 bytes, and each packet contains a header of 3 bytes, then the optimum packet size is 7.  This is because the message size is 24 bytes, and each packet contains a header of 3 bytes, so the optimum packet size is 24-3 = 7.

B) 2.2 Mbytes/sec
C) 125 Kbytes/sec

\strong{My attempt:}

I think the answer is C) 125 Kbytes/sec.

According to the question, the CPU has a 1 MIPS execution rate and it takes 4 machine cycles on average to execute an instruction. Fifty percent of the cycles use the memory bus. A memory read/write employs one machine cycle.

For execution of the programs, the system utilizes 90 percent of the CPU time.

For block data transfer, an I/O device is attached to the system while the CPU executes the background programs continuously.

So, 10% of the time is used for I/O data transfer and 90% of the time is used for execution of the programs.

The I/O data transfer rate is 10% of 125 Kbytes/sec = 12.5 Kbytes/sec.

Answer: I think your answer is wrong. The CPU has a 1 MIPS execution rate and it takes 4 machine cycles on average to execute an instruction. Fifty percent of the cycles use the memory bus. A memory read/write employs one machine cycle.

For execution of the programs, the system utilizes 90 percent of the CPU time.

For block data transfer, an I/O device is attached to the system while the CPU executes the background programs continuously.

So, 10% of the time is used for I/O data transfer and 90% of the time is used for execution of the programs.

The I/O data transfer rate is 10% of 125 Kbytes/sec = 12.5 Kbytes/sec.

"Consider the store-and-forward packet-switched network given below. Assume that the bandwidth of each link is 10⁶ bytes/sec.

I am not sure how to approach this question. I know that the file size is 10³, and the bandwidth is 10⁶ bytes/sec. I also know that the header is 100 bytes. I am not sure how to calculate the time taken for transmission.

Answer: You can solve this by using the [Bandwidth Delay Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth%E2%80%93delay_product) formula.

In this case, we have a single link between A and B, so the BDP is just the product of the bandwidth and the delay.

In the first case, a single packet is sent, so the delay is the sum of the delays of the two links.

In the second case, 10 packets are sent, so the delay is 10 times the sum of the delays of the two links.

In the third case, 20 packets are sent, so the delay is 20 times the sum of the delays of the two links.

So, in the first case, the delay is:

\begin{code}
T1 = (10^6 * 10^6) / (10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6)
T1 = 1 / (1 + 10^(-6))
T1 = 1 / 10^6
T1 = 10^6 seconds
\end{code}

In the second case, the delay is:

\begin{code}
T2 = (10^6 * 10^6) / (10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 * 10^6)
T2 = 1 / (1 + 10^(-6) + 10^(-12))
T2 = 1 / (1 + 10^(-6)) * 1 / (1 + 10^(-12))
T2 = 1 / 10^6 * 1 / 10^12
T2 = 10^6 * 10^12 seconds
\end{code}

In the third case, the delay is:

\begin{code}
T3 = (10^6 * 10^6) / (10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 * 10^6 * 10^6)
T3 = 1 / (1 + 10^(-6) + 10^(-12) + 10^(-18))
T3 = 1 / (1 + 10^(-6)) * 1 / (1 + 10^(-12)) * 1 / (1 + 10^(-18))
T3 = 1 / 10^6 * 1 / 10^12 * 1 / 10^18
T3 = 10^6 * 10^12 * 10^18 seconds
\end{code}

So, the correct answer is:

\begin{code}
A) T1 < T2 < T3
\end{code}

"A and B are the only two stations on an Ethernet. Each has a steady queue of frames to send. Both A and B attempt to transmit a frame, collide, and A wins the first backoff race. At the end of this successful transmission by A, both A and B attempt to transmit and collide. The probability that A wins the second backoff race is:

A) 0.5
B) 0.625
C) 0.75
D) 1.0",B) 0.625,"Answer the question: A and B are the only two stations on an Ethernet. Each has a steady queue of frames to send. Both A and B attempt to transmit a frame, collide, and A wins the first backoff race. At the end of this successful transmission by A, both A and B attempt to transmit and collide. The probability that A wins the second backoff race is:

A) 0.5
B) 0.625
C) 0.75
D) 1.0

Answer:

A) 0.5

Explanation:

The probability of A winning the second backoff race is 0.5 because the probability of A winning the first backoff race is 0.5 and the probability of A winning the second backoff race is 0.5.

"Host A is sending data to host B over a full duplex link. A and B are using the sliding window protocol for flow control. The send and receive window sizes are 5 packets each. Data packets (sent only from A to B) are all 1000 bytes long and the transmission time for such a packet is 50 μs. Acknowledgement packets (sent only from B to A) are very small and require negligible transmission time. The propagation delay over the link is 200 μs. What is the maximum achievable throughput in this communication?

A) 7.69 × 10⁶ bytes per second
B) 11.11 × 10⁶ bytes per second
C) 12.33 × 10⁶ bytes per second
D) 15.00 × 10⁶ bytes per second",B) 11.11 × 10⁶ bytes per second,"Answer the question: Host A is sending data to host B over a full duplex link.

I know that the answer is D, but I am not sure how to get there. I am confused on how to set up the equation and what to do with the answer.

Comment: Hint:  A packet is sent every 50 μs.  In 1000 μs (1 second), how many packets can be sent?

Comment: @JonKiparsky I got 20 packets in 1 second.

Comment: What is the maximum number of packets that can be sent in 1 second?

Comment: @JonKiparsky 20 packets per second.

Comment: What is the maximum number of packets that can be sent in 1 second?

Comment: @JonKiparsky I am sorry, I don't know how to get the maximum number of packets that can be sent in 1 second.

Comment: @JonKiparsky I got 1233 packets per second.

Comment: That's right.  Now, what is the maximum number of bytes that can be sent in 1 second?

"Suppose that the stop-and-wait protocol is used on a link with a bit rate of 64 kilobits per second and 20 milliseconds propagation delay. Assume that the transmission time for the acknowledgment and the processing time at nodes are negligible. Then the minimum frame size in bytes to achieve a link utilization of at least 50% is _________.

A) 160
B) 320
C) 640
D) 220",B) 320,"Answer the question: Suppose that the stop-and-wait protocol is used on a link with a bit rate of 64 kilobits per second and 20 milliseconds propagation delay. Assume that the transmission time for the acknowledgment and the processing time at nodes are negligible. Then the minimum frame size in bytes to achieve a link utilization of at least 50% is _________.

A) 160
B) 320
C) 640
D) 220

I'm pretty sure the answer is A, but I'm not sure how to get there. I've tried to set up a table for the stop and wait protocol, but I can't seem to get the right numbers.

Answer: The stop-and-wait protocol uses a sliding window of size 1.  It sends a frame, waits for an acknowledgment, and then sends another frame.  Since the propagation delay is 20 ms, it will take at least 20 ms to get an acknowledgment.  Thus, the time between frames is 20 ms.  If we want the link utilization to be at least 50%, then the minimum frame size is:

\begin{code}
64 kbps * 20 ms / 100 = 12.8 kb
\end{code}

This is equivalent to 12800 bits, or 160 bytes.

"Consider a simplified time-slotted MAC protocol, where each host always has data to send and transmits with probability p = 0.2 in every slot. There is no backoff, and one frame can be transmitted in one slot. If more than one host transmits in the same slot, then the transmissions are unsuccessful due to collision.

D) A pushdown automaton with two stacks

I have no idea how to answer this. Can someone please help me out?

Answer: This question is asking you to design a firewall that will only allow incoming connections to be opened by internal hosts.

The way to solve this is by using a pushdown automaton with two stacks.

The first stack will be used to keep track of which connections are open and which are closed.

The second stack will be used to keep track of which hosts are allowed to open connections and which are not.

For example, if the first stack contains the string ""open"", then the firewall will allow any host to open a connection.

If the second stack contains the string ""external"", then the firewall will only allow external hosts to open connections.

Comment: Can you explain how to solve this in detail?

Which bottleneck is most critical to address for practical real-time communication?

A) The ephemeral key generation time for elliptic-curve keys
B) The complexity of group operations in the homomorphic domain leading to high computational overhead
C) The upper bound on the public key size for elliptic-curve systems
D) The necessity to store session keys indefinitely to maintain homomorphism

Answer: C) The upper bound on the public key size for elliptic-curve systems

The elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol is a widely used cryptographic protocol for establishing a shared secret between two parties. In this protocol, each party generates a public-private key pair, where the public key is made available to the other party, and the private key is kept secret. The two parties then compute a shared secret using the public keys and a shared secret is derived from the private keys.

One of the main advantages of ECDH is that it is relatively fast and efficient, making it suitable for use in real-time communication. However, there is a trade-off between speed and security. In order to ensure that the shared secret is secure, it is important to use a strong elliptic curve with a large prime number. This means that the public key size needs to be large, which can be a bottleneck for practical real-time communication.

In conclusion, the upper bound on the public key size for elliptic-curve systems is a critical bottleneck to address for practical real-time communication using ECDH.

"Host A sends a UDP datagram containing 8880 bytes of user data to host B over an Ethernet LAN. Ethernet frames may carry data up to 1500 bytes (i.e., MTU = 1500 bytes). The size of the UDP header is 8 bytes and the size of the IP header is 20 bytes. There is no option field in the IP header. How many total number of IP fragments will be transmitted and what will be the contents of the offset field in the last fragment?

A) 6 and 925
B) 6 and 7400
C) 7 and 1110
D) 7 and 8880",C) 7 and 1110,"Answer the question: Host A sends a UDP datagram containing 8880 bytes of user data to host B over an Ethernet LAN. Ethernet frames may carry data up to 1500 bytes (i.e., MTU = 1500 bytes). The size of the UDP header is 8 bytes and the size of the IP header is 20 bytes. There is no option field in the IP header. How many total number of IP fragments will be transmitted and what will be the contents of the offset field in the last fragment?

A) 6 and 925
B) 6 and 7400
C) 7 and 1110
D) 7 and 8880

I know the answer is D, but I don't know why. I know the UDP header is 8 bytes and the IP header is 20 bytes. The UDP header contains the source and destination IP addresses, source and destination UDP port numbers, and a checksum.

The IP header contains the source and destination IP addresses, the protocol type (which is 0x06 for UDP), the total length of the packet, the identification field, the flags field, the fragment offset field, the time to live field, the protocol field, the header checksum field, and the source and destination IP addresses.

So I know the total length of the packet is 8880 bytes. I know the UDP header is 8 bytes and the IP header is 20 bytes. So I think the total length of the packet is 1500 bytes.

The IP header contains a total length field, which is 16 bits long. So the maximum number of bytes that can be transmitted in a single IP packet is 65535 bytes.

The IP header also contains a fragment offset field, which is 13 bits long. So the maximum number of bytes that can be transmitted in a single IP fragment is 8192 bytes.

So I think the answer is D because the total length of the packet is 8880 bytes and the maximum number of bytes that can be transmitted in a single IP fragment is 8192 bytes.

But I'm not sure if I'm right.

I know that the transfer rate for T₁ is 100 characters/sec, but I can't figure out the transfer rate for T₂. I tried to use the following equation:

Transfer Rate = Bit Rate / (Number of Bits/Character)

Which gives me 1200/9 = 133.3333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333ttt3333t333333333t33t3ttt3333tt3t3tt3ttttttt3tttttt33ttttttttttt33tttt3333333tttttttttttttt3tt3ttttttttt33tttttttttt3tt33ttttttttttttttttttttt33333333tttttttt333tttt3333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333ttt333tt33ttttttttttttttttttttttt33ttthttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt3tttttttttttttttttttttttttt33ttttt33tttt333333ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttthttttttttttttt3tttttttt333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333ttthttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttthtttthttttttttttttttttttttttttttthttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttthttttt333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333ttttttttttthtttthtttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttthttttthtttttttttttttththtttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttthtttttttttttttttttthttttttttthttttthttttttthttthttttttttttttttththtttthtttthtttthtthttttthttttthttttttttttttthttthtttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttthttttttttttttttttttttttttthttttttttttttthttttttththtttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttthttthttttthttttttttttttttttttthttttttthtttttthtttttttttttttttttttttttttthttthtttttttttttttttttttttthtththtttttttttttttthttthttttttthtttttttttttthtttthtthttttttttttthttttttttttttthttttththtttttttthtttthtthtttthtttttttthttttttt

D) 2920 kHz",D) 2920 kHz,"Answer the question: What will be the total minimum bandwidth of the channel required for 7 channels of 400 kHz bandwidth multiplexed together with each guard band of 20 kHz?

A) 2800 kHz
B) 2600 kHz
C) 3600 kHz
D) 2920 kHz

I think it is 2800 kHz.

Comment: This is a site for asking homework questions. If you are stuck on a question, you can ask it here, but you should show your work first.

Answer: I think you are right. The answer is 2800 kHz.

Here's my work:

The bandwidth of each channel is 400 kHz.

The bandwidth of the guard band is 20 kHz.

The total bandwidth of the channel is 7 * 400 kHz + 7 * 20 kHz = 2800 kHz.

Comment: Your work is not correct.  The bandwidth of each channel is 400 kHz.  The bandwidth of the guard band is 20 kHz.  The total bandwidth of the channel is 7 * 400 kHz + 7 * 20 kHz = 2800 kHz.

Answer:

The correct answer is D.

The relative URL refers to the document in the same domain. If the client has the document in the local machine, then the relative URL will refer to the document in the local machine.

The solution is to add the base tag in W1 so that the relative URLs in W1 refer to the appropriate WebPages on the web server.

Answer:

The correct answer is D.

I am not sure how to get the answer. I know that the token bucket has a capacity of 1 megabyte and the maximum output rate is 20 megaby

"Consider a TCP connection in a state where there are no outstanding ACKs. The sender sends two segments back to back. The sequence numbers of the first and second segments are 230 and 290 respectively. The first segment was lost, but the second segment was received correctly by the receiver. Let X be the amount of data carried in the first segment (in bytes), and Y be the ACK number sent by the receiver. The values of X and Y (in that order) are

I have a question. What is the meaning of the ""lost"" part in the question?

Comment: Lost means it was never received.

Comment: @Barmar: It means the sender sent a segment with sequence number 230, but the receiver never received it.

Comment: @Barmar: 230 is the sequence number of the first segment. It was lost, so the receiver didn't receive it.

"Consider an uncompressed stereo audio signal of CD quality which is sampled at 44.1 kHz and quantized using 16 bits. What is the required storage space if a compression ratio of 0.5 is achieved for 10 seconds of this audio?

A) 172 KB
B) 430 KB
C) 860 KB
D) 1720 KB

I'm confused about this question. I know the answer is C, but I'm not sure how to get there.

I know that the uncompressed signal has a bitrate of 1,411,200 bits/second.

I know that the compressed signal has a bitrate of 705,600 bits/second.

I know that the storage space is 1,411,200 bits/second * 10 seconds = 14,112,000 bits = 1,720,000 bytes = 1.72 MB.

But I'm not sure how to get the answer from there. I've tried a few different ways, but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Comment: What is the compression ratio?

Comment: 0.5, which is 50%.

Comment: The compression ratio is 50%, which is 0.5.

Answer: The compression ratio is the ratio of the original bitrate to the compressed bitrate.

So, 1,411,200 bits/second / 705,600 bits/second = 2.00.

So, the storage space is 2.00 * 1.72 MB = 3.44 MB.

Comment: Thanks! I was overthinking it.

A) The number of regions – 1
B) E – N + 1, where E is the number of flow graph edges and N is the number of flow graph nodes
C) P – 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G
D) P + 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G

**Answer:** A) The number of regions – 1

**Explanation:** Cyclomatic complexity is defined as the number of regions in the flow graph minus one.
