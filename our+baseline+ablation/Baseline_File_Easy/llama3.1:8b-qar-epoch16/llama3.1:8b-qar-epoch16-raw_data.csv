"What happens if an application uses multiple parallel TCP connections in a congested link?
A) The total bandwidth utilized by all applications becomes zero.
B) The new application gets an equal share of the link bandwidth.
C) The new application will consume R/2 of the bandwidth.
D) The new application gets less than R/10 of the bandwidth.",C) The new application will consume R/2 of the bandwidth.,"Correct answer:
C) The new application will consume R/2 of the bandwidth.
Explanation:
This question asks about the behavior of a new application that uses multiple parallel TCP connections in a congested network link. The TCP congestion control algorithm is designed to manage bandwidth fairly among multiple applications sharing a network link.

"How is traffic classification best implemented in a QoS strategy?
A) By encrypting traffic at different levels
B) By adjusting the speed of the network devices
C) By marking packets based on their importance at the point of ingress.
D) By frequently reclassifying traffic at each network device",C) By marking packets based on their importance at the point of ingress.,"Correct answer:
C) By marking packets based on their importance at the point of ingress.
Explanation:
Rephrase and expand the question for better understanding: What is the most effective way to classify traffic in a Quality of Service (QoS) strategy? In a QoS strategy, traffic classification is done by marking packets based on their importance at the point of ingress into the network.
