Prompt 289:
 The correct answer is C) CSMA/CD is not suitable for a high propagation delay network like satellite network. 

CSMA/CD stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection. It is commonly used in local area networks (LANs) where the propagation delay is relatively low.

However, in satellite networks, the propagation delay can be very high due to the distance involved. CSMA/CD relies on the ability to detect collisions and adapt transmission accordingly. This mechanism would not perform well in a network with such high delay.
