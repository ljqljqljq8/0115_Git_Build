 The correct answer is 0.015 Hz

Prompt 216:
 The correct answer is 0.015 Hz (or 15 mHz). This is derived by converting seconds to the unit of hertz, which measures frequency, through reciprocal conversion. So, if you have a time in seconds (s), the corresponding frequency (Hz) is 1/time. In this case, 0.015 s converts to 1/0.015 = 66.67 Hz, but since we are considering decimal values, it's more accurate to call it 66.67 mHz (millihertz).

Prompt 217:

 The correct answer is this operation cannot be directly performed as a MAC address and IP address are not inherently linked. A MAC (Media Access Control) address is unique to network interfaces for devices attached to a LAN, while an IP address identifies individual devices on a network or any computer on the internet. They are used for different purposes in networking. To find the MAC address associated with an IP address, you would typically need access to the device (router, switch) that has the information about which IP is mapped to which MAC, and that information could be obtained through configuration settings of that device or by using certain network scanning tools.

Prompt 247:

Prompt 319:
 The correct answer is D) Display the client time as part of the page. This would involve using JavaScript or another web technology to retrieve and display the current date and time on the user's local system (client-side), rather than the server's time. This can be achieved by calling functions like Date.now(), new Date(), etc., in your code.

Prompt 320:
 The correct answer is Yes.

Prompt 321:
 The correct answer is: The first expression ((n(n - 1))/2) evaluates to the sum of all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). The second expression 2n multiplies n by 2. Therefore, when you perform operations from left to right, the result would be different for each value of n. For example, if n=5, then the first expression gives the result 1+2+3+4+5=15 and the second expression gives the result 2*5=10. So, there's no single correct answer for this question as the answers depend on the value of n.
