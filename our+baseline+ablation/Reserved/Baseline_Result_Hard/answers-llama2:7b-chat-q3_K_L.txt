Prompt 112:
 The correct answer is (C) Implement a dynamic routing algorithm that recalculates paths in real-time.

A dynamic routing algorithm is a type of routing algorithm that continuously updates and adjusts the best path based on changing network conditions, such as link failures or changes in traffic patterns. This allows the algorithm to maintain an up-to-date and optimal path for each data packet, even in real-time.

In contrast, a static routing algorithm only considers the initial topology of the network when calculating paths, and does not recalculate paths as the network changes. This can result in suboptimal paths being used, leading to increased latency or dropped packets.

By implementing a dynamic routing algorithm, the network can adapt to changing conditions in real-time, ensuring that data packets are transmitted efficiently and reliably.

 The correct answer is (A) Decrease the subnet mask length to reduce the number of bits used for subnetting.

Prompt 123:
 The correct answer is (D) Employ BGP to manage the routes advertised by each ISP and prevent routing loops.

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a path vector routing protocol that is used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems (AS) on the internet. By employing BGP, organizations can manage the routes advertised by each ISP and prevent routing loops from occurring.

Here's how BGP works:

1. BGP peers: Each ISP sets up a BGP peer relationship with its upstream ISPs to exchange route information.
2. Route advertisements: Each ISP advertises its own routes to its BGP peers, along with the distance vector that represents how good the path is to reach the destination network.
3. Route selection: When a router receives a route advertisement from an upstream ISP, it selects the best path based on the distance vector and other factors such as latency and packet loss.
4. Route propagation: Once a path has been selected, the router propagates the route to its own customers, ensuring that traffic is sent through the preferred path.

By using BGP to manage routes advertised by each ISP, organizations can prevent routing loops from occurring and ensure that traffic is directed to the most efficient path.

Prompt 242:
 The correct answer is (C) Prevent packets from looping indefinitely.

In the OSI model, the switch is responsible for forwarding packets to their destination based on the destination MAC address. However, if a packet loops through the same switch multiple times, it can cause issues such as packet loss, jitter, and increased latency. To prevent this from happening, switches use a variety of techniques, including:

* Loopback prevention: This technique is used to prevent packets from looping back into the switch. The switch uses a mechanism called "switching loopback" to identify when a packet is trying to loop back and discards it.
* Packet filtering: This technique is used to filter out packets that are attempting to loop back through the switch. The switch examines the destination MAC address of each incoming packet and blocks any packets that are not meant for any device on the same network segment.
* Route poisoning: This technique is used to prevent packets from looping through a switch multiple times. The switch sets a "route poison" bit in the packet's IP header, which indicates that the packet should be sent directly to its destination without being forwarded through the switch again.

 The question is asking to determine which of two statements is true based on the given premises. Let's analyze each statement:

Statement (i): "If the company had not implemented the new policy, it would have faced a fine of $50,000."

Statement (ii): "The company was able to avoid the fine by paying an additional amount of $30,000."

Now, let's evaluate each statement:

Statement (i) is true because if the company had not implemented the new policy, it would have faced a fine of $50,000. This is a logical consequence of the situation described in the premise. Therefore, Statement (i) is true.

Statement (ii) is false because the company did not avoid the fine by paying an additional amount of $30,000. The premise states that the company faced a fine of $50,000 despite not implementing the new policy, which means that paying an additional amount of $30,000 would not have avoided the fine. Therefore, Statement (ii) is false.

The correct answer is: C) Statement (ii) is false and the other is true.

 The correct answer is:

C) ((n(n - 1))/2)

Explanation:
The formula for the number of ways to arrange n objects in a row is given by the recursion formula:

f(n) = (n(n - 1))/2

This formula can be derived by considering the number of ways to arrange n objects in a row, and subtracting off the number of ways to arrange n-1 objects in a row. The result is the number of ways to arrange n objects in a row, which is equal to (n(n - 1))/2.

Additionally, we have:

2n = 2 x (n + 0) = n + 0

So, the answer is C) ((n(n - 1))/2).
