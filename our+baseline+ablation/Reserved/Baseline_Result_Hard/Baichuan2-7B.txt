Prompt 0:
To design a baseband digital transmission system that can achieve a minimum data rate of 20 Mbps, while being constrained by a channel with a 3-dB bandwidth of 3 MHz, we need to consider the modulation efficiency. The modulation efficiency is defined as the bit rate divided by the carrier frequency, and it represents how many bits are transmitted per hertz. In this case, the minimum required modulation efficiency is:

Modulation efficiency = Data rate / Carrier frequency
                                  = 20 Mbps / 3 MHz
                                  = 20,000 bits/s / 3,000,000 Hz
                                  = 0.0667 bits/s/Hz

Therefore, the minimum required modulation efficiency to meet the data rate requirement is 0.0667 bits/s/Hz, which corresponds to option B) 6.67 bits/s/Hz.
