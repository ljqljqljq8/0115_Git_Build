Prompt 57:
 The correct answer is D) By sending an ARP request to ensure no other device is using the assigned IP address before finalizing the assignment.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses.

Prompt 248:
 The correct answer is 158

A step-by-step solution:
1. Calculate the squares of 2, 3, 4, and 5 using the formula: square = number ** 2
2. Sum the squares of the numbers: 4, 9, 16, 25 = 59
3. Add 1 to the sum: 59 + 1 = 60
4. Multiply the result by 2: 60 * 2 = 120
5. Add 38 to the product: 120 + 38 = 158

Therefore, the correct answer is 158.

 The correct answer is B) If the header length is greater than 5 (i.e., it is from 6 to 15) it means that the options field is present and must be considered.

If the header length is greater than 5, then the options field is present and must be considered. This is because the header length is used to determine the length of the header, and if the header length is greater than 5, then the header must contain the options field.

Prompt 255:
 The correct answer is C) To know if intended packet is supposed to send to router or not.

Prompt 261:
 The correct answer is C) 62 subnets and 1022 hosts.

Given the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, we can calculate the number of subnets and hosts as follows:

**Subnets:**
The number of subnets is given by the formula:

```
Number of subnets = 32 - (log(n) / log(2))
```

where n is the number of hosts in the subnet mask.

Substituting the values, we get:

```
Number of subnets = 32 - (log(2^255) / log(2)) = 62
```

**Hosts:**
The number of hosts in a subnet is given by the formula:

```
Number of hosts = 2^(n-1) - 1
```

where n is the number of bits in the subnet mask.

Substituting the values, we get:

```
Number of hosts = 2^(255-2) - 1 = 1022
```

Therefore, the correct answer is C) 62 subnets and 1022 hosts.
