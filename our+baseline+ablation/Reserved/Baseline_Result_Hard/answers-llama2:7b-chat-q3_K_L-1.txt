Prompt 112:
 The correct answer is (C) Implement a dynamic routing algorithm that recalculates paths in real-time.

A dynamic routing algorithm is one that continuously updates and recalculates the best path based on changing network conditions, rather than using a fixed routing table that may become outdated over time. This approach allows for more efficient use of network resources and can help ensure that traffic is directed along the most optimal path in real-time.

In contrast, (A) Using a static routing algorithm would result in slower response times as the best path would not be recalculated in real-time. (B) Implementing a routing protocol that stores the shortest path in memory would also result in slower response times, as the entire routing table would need to be recalculated each time a new network condition is detected.

Therefore, option (C) Implement a dynamic routing algorithm that recalculates paths in real-time, is the best answer for this question.

Prompt 113:

 The correct answer is:
A) Decrease the subnet mask length to reduce the number of bits used for subnetting.

Prompt 123:
 The correct answer is: D) Employ BGP to manage the routes advertised by each ISP and prevent routing loops.

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a popular exterior gateway protocol used to exchange routing information among multiple autonomous systems (AS) on the internet. By employing BGP, ISPs can manage the routes advertised by each other and prevent routing loops that can occur due to the complex network topology and the large number of ISPs involved in the internet.

In BGP, each ISP maintains a unique identifier, called an AS number, which is used to identify their autonomous system on the internet. When an ISP receives a routing update from another ISP, it checks the advertised routes against its own routing table and selects the best path based on factors such as distance vector, metrics, and routing policies. BGP also supports route filtering, which allows ISPs to filter out unwanted routes based on criteria such as AS path length or prefix length.

By using BGP to manage the routes advertised by each ISP, the internet can avoid routing loops that can occur due to multiple paths between two destinations. This helps ensure efficient route selection and reduce the risk of network instability caused by routing loops.

Prompt 131:
 The correct answer is: D) 32 bits for AdvertisedWindow and 40 bits for SequenceNum due to the high speed and need for precise sequence numbering.

Prompt 132:
 The correct answer is (D) Use the maximum segment lifetime to calculate sequence number bits, while window size bits are determined by RTT and bandwidth.

In this approach, the maximum segment lifetime (MSL) is used as the unit of measurement for calculating the sequence number bits. The MSL is the maximum time duration between two consecutive segments in a stream. By dividing the MSL into smaller units called slot times, the sequence number bits can be calculated. Each slot time represents a portion of the MSL and is used to generate the sequence number.

On the other hand, the window size bits are determined by the RTT and bandwidth. The RTT is the round-trip time between the sender and receiver, which is used to calculate the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a window before it becomes too large. The bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over the network in a given time period. By combining these two factors, the optimal window size can be determined, which in turn determines the number of bits required to represent the window size.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

Prompt 133:

 The correct answer is (C) DNS requests are generally very small and fit well within UDP segments. DNS (Domain Name System) requests are typically short messages that contain a domain name or IP address, along with other information necessary to perform the DNS lookup. As such, they can be easily transmitted over UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which is designed for small, efficient message transmission. The size of a typical DNS request is usually in the range of a few hundred bytes to a few kilobytes, making them well-suited for UDP's small packet sizes.

Prompt 242:
 The correct answer is (C) Prevent packets from looping indefinitely. In a TCP/IP network, routers use routing tables to determine the best path for forwarding packets to their destination. When a packet reaches a router, it checks its routing table to determine the next hop towards the destination network. However, if the packet encounters multiple hops with the same next hop, it can create a loop where the packet keeps circulating between the routers without reaching its final destination. To prevent this, routers use techniques such as distance vector routing and link-state routing to determine the shortest path to the destination and avoid loops.

Prompt 243:
 The correct answer is: D) S1 and S3 are true, but S2 is false.

D. Finding the MAC address that corresponds to an IP address

Explanation:
Finding the MAC (Media Access Control) address that corresponds to an IP (Internet Protocol) address is a common task in networking. The MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to each network interface card (NIC) and is used to identify devices on a network. By using the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), you can find the MAC address that corresponds to a given IP address.

Prompt 247:

Prompt 267:
 The given statement is:

"Either statement (i) or statement (ii) is true, but not both."

So, we need to determine which statement is true and which one is false. Let's analyze the statements:

Statement (i): "The average cost of a data breach for a small business is $200,000."

Statement (ii): "The average cost of a data breach for a large enterprise is $1 million."

Now, we need to determine which statement is true and which one is false. Let's consider the context of the statements:

Small businesses typically have fewer employees and less complex systems compared to large enterprises. This means that the cost of a data breach for a small business is likely to be lower than for a large enterprise. In fact, according to a study by IBM, the average cost of a data breach for a small business is around $200,000.

On the other hand, large enterprises have more employees and more complex systems, which can lead to higher costs in the event of a data breach. However, the cost of a data breach for a large enterprise may not be as high as $1 million, especially if the breach is not severe or widespread.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that:

The correct answer is (ii) Statement (ii) is true and statement (i) is false.

Prompt 289:
 The correct answer is (C): CSMA/CD is not suitable for a high propagation delay network like satellite network.

CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) is a widely used access method in wireless networks, but it may not be the best choice for networks with high propagation delays, such as satellite networks. This is because CSMA/CD relies on the media access control (MAC) protocol to manage contention and resolve collisions between devices. In a high propagation delay network, the MAC protocol may take longer to detect and resolve collisions, leading to increased latency and decreased network performance.

In contrast, other access methods such as TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) or FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) may be more suitable for high propagation delay networks, as they do not rely on collision detection and can provide faster access to the media.

Prompt 290:
 The correct answer is (D) Bridge reduces broadcast domain.

When a switch is used to connect multiple devices, it forms a separate broadcast domain for each device. This means that each device only receives broadcast traffic intended for its own network segment, and not for any other segment. By contrast, a bridge does not create separate broadcast domains for each device, but rather treats all devices on the same physical network as belonging to a single broadcast domain. As a result, bridge reduces the number of broadcast domains that need to be managed and monitored.

Prompt 313:
 The correct answer is (B): Q needs to send at least 2 HTTP requests to S.

In this scenario, Q and S are two separate systems that need to communicate with each other. To do so, Q must send at least two HTTP requests to S, one for each of the following reasons:

1. To establish a connection: Before Q can send any data to S, it needs to establish a connection with S. This is done by sending an initial HTTP request (such as a GET or POST request) to S to initiate the connection.
2. To transfer data: Once the connection is established, Q can send data to S using subsequent HTTP requests (such as a PUT or POST request).

Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer because Q needs to send at least two HTTP requests to S in order to communicate with it.

Prompt 321:
 The correct answer is:

C) ((n(n - 1))/2)

Explanation:

The formula for the number of ways to choose a subset of items from a total of n items is given by:

((n(n - 1))/2)

This can be derived by considering the number of ways to select 1 item from a total of n items, which is n. Then, the number of ways to select 2 items from a total of n items is n-1, since we cannot select the same item twice. The formula continues in this manner, with the number of ways to select k items being (n-k+1).

Therefore, the total number of ways to choose a subset of items from a total of n items is:

((n(n - 1))/2)

This is the correct answer.
