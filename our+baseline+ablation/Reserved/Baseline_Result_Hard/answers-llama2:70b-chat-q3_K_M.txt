 The correct answer is B

Prompt 131:
 The correct answer is D) 32 bits for AdvertisedWindow and 40 bits for SequenceNum.

Prompt 132:
 The correct answer is D.

Explanation:

The maximum segment lifetime is the maximum amount of time a segment can be in transit before it must be retransmitted. This value is typically determined by the network administrator and is used to calculate the sequence number bits.

The window size, on the other hand, is determined by the round-trip time (RTT) and bandwidth of the network. The RTT is the time it takes for a packet to be sent, received, and acknowledged, while the bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over the network in a given amount of time.

Therefore, option D is correct because it uses the maximum segment lifetime to calculate sequence number bits, while the window size bits are determined by RTT and bandwidth.

Prompt 141:
 The correct answer is C) Implementing a passive monitoring tool that analyzes traffic metadata.

Prompt 142:
 The correct answer is B) Using secure communication protocols such as HTTPS or SFTP.

Explanation:
End-to-end encryption means that only the sender and the intended recipient can access the encrypted data. AES-256 is a Symmetric key block cipher which is fast and efficient but it is not suitable for end-to-end encryption. To achieve end-to-end encryption, we need to use secure communication protocols such as HTTPS or SFTP that provide both confidentiality and authentication. These protocols use asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, and certificates to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the data being transmitted.

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a variant of the HTTP protocol that adds an extra layer of security by using the SSL/TLS protocol. It provides end-to-end encryption for data transmitted between the client and the server.

SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is a secure version of FTP that uses SSH (Secure Shell) to encrypt both the authentication process and the data being transferred.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Prompt 289:
 The correct answer is C) CSMA/CD is not suitable for a high propagation delay network like satellite network.

Explanation:
CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) is a media access control (MAC) protocol that is commonly used in local area networks (LANs). It relies on the detection of collisions to prevent simultaneous transmission by multiple devices on the same channel. However, in a high propagation delay network like a satellite network, the round-trip time (RTT) between nodes can be significant, making it difficult for devices to detect collisions and respond appropriately.

In a satellite network, the signal travels a long distance through space, which introduces significant latency. The RTT between nodes can be hundreds of milliseconds or even seconds, depending on the distance between the nodes and the speed of light. This makes it difficult for devices to detect collisions using CSMA/CD, as the collision detection mechanism relies on the receipt of a jam signal within a certain time window.

Therefore, CSMA/CD is not suitable for high propagation delay networks like satellite networks, and other media access control protocols like Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) or Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) are better suited for these types of networks.

Prompt 316:
 The correct answer is B) Only (S1) and (S3) are not correct.

Explanation:

(S1) "The teacher is writing on the blackboard." is not a correct sentence because it does not have a main verb. "Writing" is a present participle, not a main verb.

(S2) "The teacher writes on the blackboard." is a correct sentence. The subject "teacher" performs the action of the verb "writes".

(S3) "The blackboard is written on by the teacher." is not a correct sentence because it is in the passive voice and does not have a main verb. "Written" is a past participle, not a main verb.

Therefore, only (S1) and (S3) are not correct sentences.

Prompt 321:
 The correct answer is:
C) ((n(n - 1))/2) and 2n

The formula for the number of ways to arrange n objects in a row is (n(n - 1))/2. This formula can be derived by considering the fact that each object has n possible positions, and the first object can be placed in any of those positions, the second object can be placed in any of the remaining n - 1 positions, and so on. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange n objects in a row is (n(n - 1))/2.

On the other hand, the formula for the number of ways to arrange n objects in a circle is 2n. This formula can be derived by considering the fact that each object has two possible orientations (clockwise or counterclockwise) and there are n possible positions for each object in the circle. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange n objects in a circle is 2n.

So, the correct answer is:
C) ((n(n - 1))/2) and 2n.
