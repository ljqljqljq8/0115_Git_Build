Prompt 0:
The correct answer is B) 6.67 bits/s/Hz.

To meet the data rate requirement of 20 Mbps with a channel bandwidth of 3 MHz, the minimum required modulation efficiency is:

20 Mbps = 20 \* 1,000,000 bits/s

3 MHz = 3 \* 1,000,000 Hz

Modulation efficiency (bits/s/Hz) = data rate (bits/s) / channel bandwidth (Hz)

Modulation efficiency = 20 \* 1,000,000 / 3,000,000

Modulation efficiency = 6.67 bits/s/Hz

The correct answer is B) Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra's algorithm is a shortest path algorithm that finds the shortest path in a weighted graph, which is the most common approach to packet-switching networks. The algorithm calculates the shortest path by repeatedly updating the shortest path tree, which is a tree that represents the shortest path from the source node to all other nodes in the graph. The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm that can handle negative weight cycles, but it is not the most common algorithm for packet-switching networks. The distance-vector protocol is a routing algorithm that distributes the shortest path information across the network, but it is not the most common algorithm for packet-switching networks. Source routing is a routing algorithm that determines the entire path from the source node to the destination node, but it is not the most common algorithm for packet-switching networks.

Prompt 213:
The correct answer is C) 7 MSS.

In TCP's AIMD algorithm, the congestion window size is initially set to the value of the minimum segment size (MSS) multiplied by the scaling factor (2 in this case). After each successful transmission, the congestion window size increases by the MSS. On the other hand, if a timeout occurs, the congestion window size is reduced by the MSS.

In this case, the initial congestion window size is 2 \* MSS = 2 \* 14 = 28 bytes. After the first successful transmission, the congestion window size increases to 28 + 14 = 42 bytes. After the second successful transmission, it increases to 42 + 14 = 56 bytes. After the third successful transmission, it increases to 56 + 14 = 69 bytes. After the fourth successful transmission, it increases to 69 + 14 = 83 bytes. However, during the fifth transmission, a timeout occurs.

At this point, the congestion window size is reduced to 8 \* MSS = 8 \* 14 = 112 bytes. After the fifth successful transmission, the congestion window size increases to 112 + 14 = 126 bytes. After the sixth successful transmission, it increases to 126 + 14 = 140 bytes. After the seventh successful transmission, it increases to 140 + 14 = 154 bytes. After the eighth successful transmission, it increases to 154 + 14 = 168 bytes. Finally, after the ninth successful transmission, it increases to 168 + 14 = 182 bytes.

Therefore, the congestion window size at the end of the tenth transmission is 182 \* MSS = 182 \* 14 = 2728 bytes.

Prompt 262:
The correct answer is A. The first 8 bits of the incoming IP packet are 0100 0010. This corresponds to the binary value 128 in decimal. The first bit (0 or 1) indicates the direction of the packet (0 for incoming and 1 for outgoing), the second bit (0 or 1) indicates the network portion of the address, the third bit (0 or 1) indicates the host portion of the address, the fourth bit (0 or 1) indicates the packet type, and the last four bits (0000 or 1111) indicate the packet length in 32-bit words. The first four bits of the incoming packet are 0000, indicating that the packet is a 128-bit packet and not a 32-bit packet. This means that the packet can travel 2 hops before it is discarded.

Prompt 298:
The correct answer is B) 512 kbps.

Explanation: To calculate the required bit rate, we need to consider the number of characters in a page and the number of pages per second. 

Assuming an average of 24 lines with 80 characters per line, the total number of characters per page is 24 \* 80 = 1920 characters. 

If we want to download 100 pages per second, we need to download 1920 characters per second. 

The required bit rate is calculated as follows:

Bit rate = Total number of characters per second \* Number of bits per character

Bit rate = 1920 \* 8

Bit rate = 15,360 bits per second

Therefore, the required bit rate is 512 kbps or 0.512 Mbps.
