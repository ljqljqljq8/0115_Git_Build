A) To maintain network security
B) To prevent excessive control plane load and potential network failure
C) To preserve network bandwidth
D) To enhance network segmentation",B) To prevent excessive control plane load and potential network failure," The correct answer is B

Redistributing routes between protocols is a complex process that can lead to routing loops if not properly implemented.

"What is a key challenge in RPC dealing with unexpected responses, and how is it addressed?
A) The challenge is encrypting responses, which is addressed using digital certificates.
B) The challenge is dealing with server crashes and reboots, which is addressed using a boot ID.
C) The challenge is acknowledging out-of-order messages, which is done through timeouts and retransmissions.
D) The challenge is ensuring that procedure is idempotent, which is enforced by stubs.","B) The challenge is dealing with server crashes and reboots, which is addressed using a boot ID."," The correct answer is C

In RPC dealing with unexpected responses, one key challenge is acknowledging out-of-order messages. This challenge arises because RPC is a message-passing protocol, and messages can be sent out of order. To address this challenge, timeouts and retransmissions are used. Timeouts are used to wait for a message to arrive, and retransmissions are used to send a message again if it does not arrive on time.
