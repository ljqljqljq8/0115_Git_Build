"How is Message Authentication Code (MAC) different from a digital signature?
A) MAC uses a symmetric key while digital signature uses an asymmetric key
B) MAC uses an asymmetric key while digital signature uses a symmetric key
C) MAC and digital signature both use symmetric keys
D) MAC and digital signature both use asymmetric keys",A) MAC uses a symmetric key while digital signature uses an asymmetric key," The correct answer is B) MAC uses an asymmetric key while digital signature uses a symmetric key.

A MAC (Message Authentication Code) is a cryptographic checksum that protects the integrity of a message by ensuring it has not been tampered with during transmission. It uses an asymmetric key to encrypt and decrypt the message, and the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

On the other hand, a digital signature is used to authenticate the source of a message and ensure that it has not been altered in transit. It also uses an asymmetric key, but the key is used differently than in MACs. The sender uses their private key to sign the message, and the receiver uses the corresponding public key to verify the signature.

So, the main difference between MACs and digital signatures is that MACs use an asymmetric key for both encryption and decryption, while digital signatures use an asymmetric key for signing but verification is done using a public key.

B) Circuit switching allocates use of the transmission link randomly while packet switching pre-allocates use of the transmission link regardless of demand.
C) Circuit switching pre-allocates use of the transmission link based on demand while packet switching allocates use of the transmission link regardless of demand.
D) Both circuit switching and packet switching allocate use of the transmission link based on demand.","A) Circuit switching pre-allocates use of the transmission link regardless of demand with unused link time going unused, while packet switching allocates link use on demand."," The correct answer is C) Circuit switching pre-allocates use of the transmission link based on demand while packet switching allocates use of the transmission link regardless of demand.

In circuit switching, the entire communication channel is dedicated to a single connection, and the bandwidth is pre-allocated based on the demands of the application. This means that if there are multiple data streams sharing the same link, they will all be allocated a fixed portion of the bandwidth, regardless of their actual demand.

In packet switching, each data stream is given a certain amount of bandwidth on demand, so that more urgent or time-sensitive streams can use more bandwidth when needed. This allows for more efficient use of the transmission link, as less urgent streams can be given less bandwidth when they are not being used.

C) It requires a mechanism to prevent simultaneous frame transmissions by multiple nodes.
D) It allows for an unlimited number of retransmissions in case of transmission errors.",C) It requires a mechanism to prevent simultaneous frame transmissions by multiple nodes.," The correct answer is C) It requires a mechanism to prevent simultaneous frame transmissions by multiple nodes.

In a broadcast link, all devices share the same channel and transmitter, whereas in a point-to-point link, there is a dedicated channel and receiver for each device. This means that in a broadcast link, multiple devices may try to transmit simultaneously, causing collisions and errors. To prevent this, a MAC protocol for a broadcast link must include a mechanism to prevent simultaneous frame transmissions by multiple nodes, such as CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) or TDMA (Time-Division Multiple Access). In contrast, a point-to-point link does not require this mechanism since only one device is transmitting at a time.

Telnet is a service that allows users to remotely access and interact with network devices, such as servers and routers. However, allowing direct Telnet connections from the external network can pose a significant security risk, as it allows attackers to gain access to sensitive information and systems within the organization.

To protect internal users from exposure to direct Telnet connections from the external network, organizations should follow best practices and implement a combination of security measures, including:

1. Configuring a Telnet application gateway in combination with packet filtering: This involves setting up a firewall rule that allows only incoming traffic from trusted sources, such as internal networks or authorized IP addresses, to reach the Telnet service. The Telnet application gateway acts as an intermediary between the external network and the internal network, allowing only authorized traffic to pass through.
2. Restricting access to specific IP addresses: Organizations should limit access to sensitive systems and services to only specific IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses. This helps to prevent unauthorized access from unknown or suspicious sources.
3. Implementing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms: To ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive systems and services, organizations should implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC).
4. Regularly updating and patching systems and applications: To protect against known vulnerabilities and security exploits, organizations should regularly update and patch their systems and applications. This includes applying security patches and updates to operating systems, software applications, and firmware.

By implementing these security measures, organizations can effectively protect internal users from exposure to direct Telnet connections from the external network, while still allowing authorized access to sensitive systems and services.

C) Inconsistent validation standards, addressed by introducing unified compliance regulations.
D) Vulnerability of being a single point of failure, addressed by having multiple trust anchors.","D) Vulnerability of being a single point of failure, addressed by having multiple trust anchors."," The correct answer is (D) Vulnerability of being a single point of failure, addressed by having multiple trust anchors.

In the traditional PKI model, using a single root CA creates a vulnerability of being a single point of failure, as all certificates issued by this CA are trusted and validated based on this single root key. This means that if the root CA is compromised or fails, the entire PKI infrastructure can be brought down.

To address this issue, modern implementations of PKI often use multiple trust anchors, such as multiple root CAs, to distribute the trust among different entities. This way, even if one root CA is compromised or fails, the other trust anchors can still provide trust and validation for the certificates issued by the remaining functional root CAs. This reduces the vulnerability of being a single point of failure and increases the overall reliability and resilience of the PKI infrastructure.

B) They request the largest chunks from neighbours first.
C) They request chunks randomly from neighbours..
D) They request chunks that have the fewest copies among neighbours first.",D) They request chunks that have the fewest copies among neighbours first.," The correct answer is D) They request chunks that have the fewest copies among neighbors first.

In BitTorrent, peers use a strategy called ""piece-picking"" to choose which chunks to request from their neighbors. The goal of piece-picking is to maximize the efficiency of the download by selecting the chunks that are most likely to be needed in the near future.

The algorithm used by peers to select chunks for downloading is as follows:

1. The peer maintains a list of all the chunks that it has not yet received, called the ""piece list"".
2. For each chunk in the piece list, the peer checks the number of copies of that chunk that are currently available from its neighbors.
3. The peer then selects the chunk with the fewest copies and requests it from one of its neighbors.
4. If there are no chunks with fewer than a certain minimum number of copies (called the ""piece-picking threshold""), the peer waits for a short period of time and then repeats the process.

By selecting chunks that have the fewest copies, peers can ensure that they receive a balanced download of all pieces of the file, and minimize the amount of redundant data that is transferred over the network.

When both SW1 and SW2 make different changes at the same time, the switch that submits its changes first and sends out a VTP update with a higher revision number will propagate its VLAN changes. This is because the receiving switches will only accept updates with a higher revision number than their current configuration, and the switch that sends out the update first will have the highest revision number.

Therefore, if SW1 submits its changes first and sends out a VTP update with a higher revision number than SW2, then SW1's changes will be propagated, while SW2's changes will not be accepted by the other switches in the domain.

The Header Error Control (HEC) field in the ATM cell header is used to ensure the integrity of the header information. It contains a 4-bit field that provides both single-bit error detection and double-bit error detection capabilities. The HEC field is appended to the header of every ATM cell, and it is used to detect and correct errors that may occur during transmission.

The HEC field works as follows:

* Single-bit error detection: Each bit in the HEC field has a specific pattern (e.g., 0110). If any single bit in the HEC field differs from the expected pattern, an error is detected.
* Double-bit error detection: The HEC field contains two copies of the same information (e.g., 0110 and 0111). If both copies of the information do not match the expected pattern, a double error is detected.

If an error is detected, the receiving device can request that the transmitting device retransmit the cell. The HEC field also provides a means for the receiving device to acknowledge receipt of a correctly received cell or to indicate that an error was detected and a retransmission is required.

A /24 network has 256 possible host addresses (2^8). To determine the maximum number of subnets, we need to divide the number of possible host addresses by the number of hosts per subnet, which is determined by the subnet mask.

In this case, the /26 subnet mask allows for 256 - 2^4 = 252 possible hosts per subnet (2^6 - 2^4 = 2^2).

Therefore, the maximum number of subnets achievable with a /26 subnet mask is:

256 / 252 = 8

So the correct answer is C) 8 subnets.

"What is the key difference between circuit switching and packet switching?
A) Circuit switching packages data into packets while packet switching does not
B) In circuit switching, the bandwidth is reserved beforehand while in packet switching, bandwidth is allocated dynamically
C) Circuit switching requires a physical path for transmission while packet switching does not
D) Packet switching is slower than circuit switching","B) In circuit switching, the bandwidth is reserved beforehand while in packet switching, bandwidth is allocated dynamically"," The correct answer is B) In circuit switching, the bandwidth is reserved beforehand while in packet switching, bandwidth is allocated dynamically.

Circuit switching and packet switching are two different techniques used in communication networks to establish and maintain connections between devices. The key difference between them lies in how they manage resources and allocate bandwidth.

In circuit switching, a dedicated path is established between the sender and receiver before transmitting data. This means that the bandwidth is reserved for the duration of the transmission, which ensures consistent and high-quality communication. However, this also means that the bandwidth cannot be allocated dynamically or adjusted during transmission.

On the other hand, in packet switching, data is broken down into smaller packets and transmitted independently over the network. In this case, bandwidth is allocated dynamically as each packet is transmitted, which allows for more efficient use of resources and better adaptability to changing network conditions. However, this can also lead to variations in transmission quality due to the dynamic allocation of bandwidth.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Explanation:

Forward Error Correction (FEC) and Automatic Retransmission Request (ARQ) are both techniques used for error control in digital communication systems. However, they differ in their approach to detecting and correcting errors.

FEC involves adding redundancy to the data being transmitted, so that if an error occurs during transmission, the receiver can use the redundant information to recover the original data. FEC does not rely on retransmissions, as it is designed to correct errors without requiring the sender to resend the data.

ARQ, on the other hand, relies on retransmissions to detect and correct errors. When an error is detected, the receiver sends a request to the sender to retransmit the affected data. This process continues until the error is corrected or a maximum number of retransmissions is reached.

Therefore, the main difference between FEC and ARQ is that FEC involves adding redundancy to correct errors without retransmission, whereas ARQ relies on retransmissions to detect and correct errors.

Explanation: When a client queries a TLD server for a hostname, the TLD server may not always have the authoritative DNS server information for that hostname. Instead, it may only know an intermediate DNS server that is responsible for the hostname. This is because DNS servers are organized in a hierarchical structure, with the root DNS servers at the top, followed by top-level domain (TLD) servers, then secondary DNS servers, and finally authoritative DNS servers. The TLD server may only know the intermediate DNS server that is responsible for the hostname, rather than the authoritative DNS server directly.

"What is a key challenge in RPC dealing with unexpected responses, and how is it addressed?
A) The challenge is encrypting responses, which is addressed using digital certificates.
B) The challenge is dealing with server crashes and reboots, which is addressed using a boot ID.
C) The challenge is acknowledging out-of-order messages, which is done through timeouts and retransmissions.
D) The challenge is ensuring that procedure is idempotent, which is enforced by stubs.","B) The challenge is dealing with server crashes and reboots, which is addressed using a boot ID."," The correct answer is C) The challenge is acknowledging out-of-order messages, which is done through timeouts and retransmissions.

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a communication protocol that allows a program to call procedures on another computer over a network. One key challenge in RPC is dealing with unexpected responses, such as out-of-order messages. This can happen when the client sends multiple requests to the server before receiving the responses to previous requests.

To address this challenge, RPC uses several techniques, including:

* Timeouts: The client sets a timer for each request it sends to the server. If the server does not respond within a certain time period (e.g., 10 seconds), the client assumes that the server has crashed or is experiencing a severe delay and retransmits the request.
* Retransmissions: If the client receives an out-of-order response from the server, it retransmits the original request to ensure that it is processed in the correct order.

Therefore, option C is the correct answer. The other options are not related to the challenge of dealing with unexpected responses in RPC:

* Option A is incorrect because digital certificates are used for encryption, not for addressing unexpected responses.
* Option B is incorrect because server crashes and reboots are a different challenge than out-of-order messages.
* Option D is incorrect because ensuring that a procedure is idempotent (i.e., it can be called multiple times without changing the result) is not related to dealing with unexpected responses.

"What happens if an application uses multiple parallel TCP connections in a congested link?
A) The total bandwidth utilized by all applications becomes zero.
B) The new application gets an equal share of the link bandwidth.
C) The new application will consume R/2 of the bandwidth.
D) The new application gets less than R/10 of the bandwidth.",C) The new application will consume R/2 of the bandwidth.," The correct answer is C) The new application will consume R/2 of the bandwidth.

In a congested link, the total bandwidth available for all applications is limited by the capacity of the link. When an application uses multiple parallel TCP connections, it can potentially consume more than its fair share of the bandwidth, leading to congestion and reduced performance for other applications.

According to the Reno algorithm, which is widely used in TCP implementations, each new connection will be assigned a portion of the available bandwidth that is proportional to the amount of buffer space available at the sender. This means that if the link is congested, new connections will be assigned a smaller share of the bandwidth, so that the total bandwidth utilized by all applications remains within the limits of the link's capacity.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) The new application will consume R/2 of the bandwidth, where R is the available bandwidth on the link.
