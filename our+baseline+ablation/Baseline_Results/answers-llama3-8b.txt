prompt 43:
 The correct answer is D) The round-trip delay when the system actively interacts with users.

prompt 44:
 The correct answer is B) High-performance service always ensures precise bounds on delay and capacity

(Difference between Predictable Service and High-Performance Service)
Predictable service emphasizes consistent performance characteristics, such as latency and jitter, which are kept within certain bounds but may not necessarily guarantee high data rates or throughput. In contrast, high-performance service focuses on achieving precise limits on both the delay (latency) and capacity (data throughput), ensuring that the network performs optimally under these specific parameters.
