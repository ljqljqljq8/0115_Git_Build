prompt 1619:
 B) To enhance packet forwarding efficiency

prompt 1620:
 The correct answer is B: "Because the TLD server only knows the root DNS servers."

TLD (Top-Level Domain) servers, such as .com or .net, are responsible for resolving domain names to IP addresses. They do this by using a hierarchy of DNS servers. At the top of this hierarchy is the root DNS servers, which know the location of all TLD servers. When a user queries a hostname, their request first goes to their local DNS resolver (often provided by their internet service provider), which then queries the appropriate TLD server. If the TLD server does not have an entry for that specific hostname in its cache, it will need to query the next level of DNS servers in the hierarchy until it finds the authoritative DNS server for that hostname. Once the authoritative DNS server is found, it will provide the IP address of the queried hostname. However, if a TLD server only knows the root DNS servers and not the specific TLD server or any intermediate DNS servers that are responsible for the hostname in question, it may not be able to find the authoritative DNS server and will return an error.
