Explanation:
Desired properties of a routing algorithm include correctness, complexity, robustness, stability, fairness, and efficiency. Correctness ensures that the algorithm finds optimal or near-optimal routes. Complexity refers to the time and space complexity of the algorithm. Robustness deals with handling changes in the network topology. Stability ensures that the algorithm converges to a valid and stable routing state. Fairness distributes the traffic load fairly among different routes. Efficiency measures the overall performance of the algorithm in terms of routing overhead and convergence time.
