prompt 225:
 To answer this question, we should know that:  
An IP loopback address is an IP address assigned to a host by its own IP stack or by another host for communication between them. When an Ethernet cable connects two computers with the same IP addresses and the same MAC addresses, but the computers do not communicate, there must be some other reason than just their IP addresses being the same. The loopback test is performed using IP loopback address 127.0.0.1, which returns a response of its own IP address (127.0.0.1). A computer can run loopback tests to determine if it has a functioning network card and to check for other issues, such as a driver conflict or a malfunctioning NIC. Looped MAC addresses cause the switch to continuously scan all ports for active hosts on that port. This results in continuous changes of the media access control (MAC) address table entries on each port which is constantly being updated due to a looped environment.

 To answer the question, consider the following: Routers use several types of switching algorithms. These include store-and-forward, cut-through, and hybrid, which differ in their response time to packet delivery. When multiple packets are stored in a queue, a router may perform better than another that has no storage facilities. Also, when the queue is full, the performance of the router will be slower. In general, higher processing speed of the router leads to faster network performance, but with different switching methods, varying router performances can lead to varying speeds of response time in routers. The physical size of the router and power supply are not relevant factors for this question.

 The correct answer is A) For data encryption.

Nonces are random numbers that are used to provide an additional layer of security for SSL connections. They are commonly used when performing secure transactions over the internet, such as online banking or shopping. Nonces work by generating a unique number each time they are sent between two parties in a secure connection. This ensures that any attempt to intercept or tamper with the data during transmission is immediately detected and prevented. Nonces also help prevent replay attacks, where an attacker tries to use previously recorded encrypted data to gain unauthorized access to a system or website. Nonces provide an additional layer of security beyond traditional encryption techniques, making them essential for secure transactions on the internet.

prompt 999:
 The correct answer is D) NACKs eliminate the need for congestion control.

Explanation: QUIC uses negative acknowledgments (NACKs) instead of the SACK option in TCP to improve its performance. One key advantage of using NACKs over SACK or triple ACK is that it eliminates the need for congestion control mechanisms, which can be more efficient and faster than traditional methods. With NACKs, if a packet is lost or damaged during transmission, the receiver sends an immediate "no data received" message to the sender, rather than waiting for multiple acknowledgments before confirming data delivery. This allows for more direct feedback between the sender and receiver, resulting in faster and more efficient communication.

 The correct answer is B) The bind() method.TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two different types of sockets used for communication over a network. TCP sockets provide reliable, ordered delivery of data, while UDP sockets do not guarantee such delivery. One distinguishing characteristic of a TCP socket from a UDP socket is the bind() method. In TCP, you can use the bind() method to associate a specific IP address and port with a socket. This allows the socket to receive incoming connections on that specific IP address and port. With UDP, this is not required and there is no such binding functionality.
