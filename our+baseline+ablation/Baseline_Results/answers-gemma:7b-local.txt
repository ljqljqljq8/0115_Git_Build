Prompt 871:
 The correct answer is A.

TCP Vegas uses two mechanisms to decide its congestion window size: Current Window Size and Old Window Size.

Prompt 872:
 The correct answer is A

Explanation:
In a connectionless service at the transport layer, the absence of flow control, error control, and congestion control results in a potential disorder in packet delivery and loss of data without the recipient's awareness. This is because the packets are sent individually without any mechanism to regulate their flow, detect errors, or manage congestion. As a consequence, the data delivery can be unreliable and prone to loss, leading to a potential disorder in the packet delivery and loss of data without the recipient's awareness.

Prompt 939:
 The correct answer is C

Circuit-switched networks are connection-oriented networks, which means that they establish a dedicated connection between two devices before data is transmitted. This connection is maintained for the duration of the communication, and all data is transmitted over the same connection.

The main disadvantage of circuit-switched networks is that all resources must be available and dedicated throughout the network before communication takes place. This is because the connection is established before data is transmitted, and if any of the resources are not available, the connection will not be established.

Prompt 946:
 The correct answer is C

When redistributing routes into OSPF, the "subnets" keyword is used to ensure that all subnetted routes are included in the redistribution process. This is because the "subnets" keyword instructs OSPF to redistribute all routes that are subnetted from the source network.

Prompt 947:
 The correct answer is A

Static routes are redistributed into dynamic routing protocols to ensure that the static route is known beyond the local router. This is because static routes are not stored in the routing table of the local router, but are instead stored in the routing table of the router that is responsible for the network segment where the static route is defined. When the local router needs to find a route to a destination, it will consult the routing table of the router that is responsible for the network segment where the static route is defined.

The checksum of the datagram is computed over the entire datagram, including the pseudoheader.

Prompt 956:
 The correct answer is C

In TCP Vegas, if ActualRate is consistently exceeding the ExpectedRate by a significant margin, the congestion window size is decreased. This is because the system wants to prevent the network from becoming overloaded, and reducing the congestion window size helps to slow down the rate of data transfer.
