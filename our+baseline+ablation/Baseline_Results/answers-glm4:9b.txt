Explanation:
In object-oriented programming (OOP), there are concepts of classes that encapsulate data (services), the methods or functions that operate on the data (interfaces), and the actual implementation details of these methods (protocols). Similarly, the OSI model distinguishes between services provided at each layer, interfaces between layers, and protocols used for communication across those interfaces. This distinction aligns with the OOP paradigm where there is a clear separation of concerns.

 The correct answer is B) It causes the client application buffer to store less video data. 

Explanation: TCP's congestion avoidance mechanism works by reducing the rate at which new packets are sent into the network, helping to prevent network congestion. When bandwidth is reduced due to congestion, this can cause video streaming clients to need a larger buffer to smooth out playback during periods of lower quality or speed. In effect, it leads to a situation where less data might be received in a given time frame before congestion occurs again, effectively making the client application buffer store less video data before playing it back.

prompt 1539:
 The correct answer is B) By reducing the vulnerable period from one or two-frame transmission times to a single propagation delay.

Explanation: CSMA-CD improves bandwidth utilization over ALOHA and CSMA schemes by having a reduced window of opportunity for collisions. In ALOHA, the entire frame can be lost due to collision with other frames during any part of the transmission. In pure CSMA, the vulnerability period is one frame time; if another station transmits simultaneously, collisions occur. With CSMA-CD, after sending a frame, it listens for an acknowledgment or for the absence of a signal that would indicate a collision. This process reduces the vulnerable period to just the single propagation delay between stations, thus reducing the likelihood of collisions and improving overall efficiency.
