Prompt 49:
 The correct answer is indeed D) P + 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G.

In a flow graph G, each predicate node corresponds to a branch instruction in the program that depends on the outcome of a conditional expression. The number of predicate nodes (P) in the flow graph represents the number of conditional branches that can be executed in parallel.

Therefore, the maximum number of instructions that can be executed in parallel is P + 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G. This is because each predicate node can execute one instruction in parallel, and there is one additional instruction that can be executed at the root of the flow graph (representing the entry point of the function).

So, the correct answer is D) P + 1.
