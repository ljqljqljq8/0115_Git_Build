Prompt 26:
The correct answer is B) 14 MSS.

In TCP's Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) algorithm, the congestion window size is calculated as:

cwnd = min(max(cwnd + a, ssthresh), cwnd)

where a is the additive increase factor, cwnd is the current congestion window size, and ssthresh is the slow start threshold.

At the start of the slow start phase, the window size is 2 MSS and the threshold is 8 MSS. In the given scenario, we have:

cwnd = min(max(2 + a, 8), 2)

Since a is not explicitly given, we can assume a value for it. Let's assume a = 1. Then:

cwnd = min(max(2 + 1, 8), 2) = min(9, 2) = 2

At the end of the first transmission, the congestion window size increases to 2 MSS.

cwnd = min(max(2 + 1, 8), cwnd) = min(max(2 + 1, 8), 2) = min(9, 2) = 2

After the fifth transmission, the congestion window size increases to 4 MSS.

cwnd = min(max(4 + 1, 8), cwnd) = min(max(4 + 1, 8), 2) = min(9, 2) = 2

At the end of the tenth transmission, the congestion window size increases to 6 MSS.

cwnd = min(max(6 + 1, 8), cwnd) = min(max(6 + 1, 8), 2) = min(9, 2) = 2

The correct answer is B) 14 MSS.
