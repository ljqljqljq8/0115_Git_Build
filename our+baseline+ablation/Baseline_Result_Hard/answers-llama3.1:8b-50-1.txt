Prompt 25:
 Let's calculate the answer.

## Step 1: Calculate the value of /21
To calculate the value of /21, we need to find the first available address in this subnet and add 2^21-1 to get the last available address. Since 245.248.136.0 is the first available address in this subnet, we can represent it as (245.248.128.0) + (2^7). This will give us the first available address in /22 subnet.

## Step 2: Calculate the value of /22
Now let's calculate the last address in the /21 and /22 subnets using the formulas:
- First available IP = A + B
- Last available IP = A + (B - 1)

Where A is the start of the block, and B is the number of host bits.

## Step 3: Convert to binary for easier calculation
For a /21 subnet, we can calculate it as follows:
The IP address in binary form for /22 is 11000001.10101111.10000000.00000000 (first available address) and 11000001.10101112.10000000.11111111 (last available address).
For a /21 subnet, the first available address will be (11000001.10101111.10000000.00000000) and last available address will be (11000001.10101111.10000001.11111111).

## Step 4: Find the difference between the subnets
Comparing both addresses in binary form, we find that:
- The first available IP for /21 is 245.248.136.0
- And the last available IP for /22 is 245.248.129.255

The difference between them is 7.


The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$
