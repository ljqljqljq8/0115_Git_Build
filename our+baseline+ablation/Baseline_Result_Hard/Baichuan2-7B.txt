Prompt 0:
The correct answer is: The correct answer is C) 280

Prompt 1:
To solve this problem, we need to use the following formula:

Signal speed = Data rate / Frame size (in bytes) * 8 / 10²

Since the data rate is 100 Mbps (10^8 bits per second), and the frame size is 1250 bytes, we can calculate the signal speed as follows:

Signal speed = 100,000,000 / 1,250 * 8 / 10²
Signal speed = 8000 km/sec

Therefore, the correct answer is A): 8000.

Prompt 9:
The correct answer is B) 64 subnets and 262142 hosts

Prompt 10:
To calculate the efficiency, we need to use the formula: Efficiency = Bandwidth / RTT * PacketSize.
Bandwidth = 1.5 Mbps = 1500 Kbps
RTT = 45 ms = 0.045 s
PacketSize = 1 KB = 1024 Bytes
Efficiency = 1500 Kbps / 0.045 s * 1024 Bytes = 3.3 Mbps
Now, we can compare the efficiency with other options:
3.3 Mbps > 20.3 Mbps: No, it's not the correct answer.
3.3 Mbps > 10.0 Mbps: No, it's not the correct answer.
3.3 Mbps > 12 Mbps: Yes, the correct answer is B) 10.0.
