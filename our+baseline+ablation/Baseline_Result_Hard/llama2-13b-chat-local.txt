Prompt 0:
Answer the question: Consider the following dynamic programming code snippet for solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem:

def knapsack(values, weights, capacity, n):
    if n == 0 or capacity == 0:
        return 0
    if weights[n-1] > capacity:
        return knapsack(values, weights, capacity, n-1)
    else:
        return max(values[n-1] + knapsack(values, weights, capacity-weights[n-1], n-1),
                   knapsack(values, weights, capacity, n-1))
Given the values [60, 100, 120] and weights [10, 20, 30], what would be the output of calling knapsack(values, weights, 50, 3)?

A) 180
B) 220
C) 280
D) 300

Please explain your answer.

Here's my solution:

The input values and weights are [60, 100, 120] and [10, 20, 30], respectively. The capacity is 50, and the number of items is 3.

To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we first need to compute the values of knapsack(values, weights, capacity, 0) and knapsack(values, weights, capacity, 1). These values represent the maximum value that can be obtained with 0 and 1 item, respectively.

knapsack(values, weights, capacity, 0) = 0 (since there are no items)

knapsack(values, weights, capacity, 1) = max(values[0] + knapsack(values, weights, capacity - weights[0], 0), knapsack(values, weights, capacity, 0))
= max(60 + knapsack(values, weights, 50, 0), 0)
= max(60 + knapsack(values, weights, 50, 1), 0)

Now, we can compute the value of knapsack(values, weights, capacity, 2) using the recursive formula:

knapsack(values, weights, capacity, 2) = max(values[1] + knapsack(values, weights, capacity - weights[1], 1), knapsack(values, weights, capacity, 1))
= max(100 + knapsack(values, weights, 50, 1), knapsack(values, weights, 50, 2))
= max(100 + knapsack(values, weights, 50, 3), knapsack(values, weights, 50, 2))

Continuing this process, we get:

knapsack(values, weights, capacity, 3) = max(120 + knapsack(values, weights, capacity - weights[2], 2), knapsack(values, weights, capacity, 2))
= max(120 + knapsack(values, weights, 50, 3), knapsack(values, weights, 50, 2))

Since the maximum value that can be obtained with 3 items is 120 + knapsack(values, weights, 50, 3), which is equal to 280, the output of calling knapsack(values, weights, 50, 3) would be:

C) 280

Therefore, the correct answer is C) 280.

Prompt 1:
Answer the question: Consider a CSMA/CD network that transmits data at a rate of 100 Mbps (10⁸ bits per second) over a 1 km (kilometre) cable with no repeaters. If the minimum frame size required for this network is 1250 bytes, what is the signal speed (km/sec) in the cable?

A) 8000
B) 10000
C) 16000
D) 20000

Hint: The signal speed is the speed at which the signal travels through the cable. To calculate the signal speed, you need to know the distance of the cable and the rate at which data is transmitted.

Answer: C) 16000

Explanation:

To calculate the signal speed, we need to use the formula:

Signal speed = Distance / Data rate

In this case, the distance is 1 km (1000 m) and the data rate is 100 Mbps (10⁸ bits per second).

First, let's convert the data rate to bits per second:

100 Mbps x 1000 (to convert Mbps to bits per second) = 10⁸ bits per second

Now, we can calculate the signal speed:

Signal speed = 1000 m / 10⁸ bits per second

Signal speed = 1000 / 10⁸

Signal speed = 0.001 (to convert meters to kilometers)

Signal speed = 0.001 km/s

Therefore, the signal speed in the cable is 0.001 km/s or 16000 km/s.

The correct answer is C) 16000.

Prompt 2:
Answer the question: Consider a network using the pure ALOHA medium access control protocol, where each frame is of length 1,000 bits. The channel transmission rate is 1 Mbps (=10⁶ bits per second). The aggregate number of transmissions across all the nodes (including new frame transmissions and retransmitted frames due to collisions) is modelled as a Poisson process with a rate of 1,000 frames per second. Throughput is defined as the average number of frames successfully transmitted per second. The throughput of the network (rounded to the nearest integer) is ______________ .

A) 130 to 140
B) 140 to 150
C) 120 to 130
D) 100 to 110

Answer: C) 120 to 130

Explanation:
The throughput of the network can be calculated using the formula:

Throughput = (Number of successful transmissions per second) / (Number of transmissions per second)

In this case, the number of successful transmissions per second is given as 1,000 frames per second (since each frame is of length 1,000 bits, and the channel transmission rate is 1 Mbps, which is equivalent to 1,000,000 bits per second).

The number of transmissions per second is given as 1,000 frames per second (as mentioned in the question).

Therefore, the throughput of the network is:

Throughput = (1,000 frames per second) / (1,000 frames per second) = 1

Since the throughput is 1, the answer is C) 120 to 130.

Prompt 3:
Answer the question: Consider a link with packet loss probability of 0.2. What is the expected number of transmissions it would take to transfer 200 packets given that the stop and wait protocol is used?

A) 125
B) 250
C) 225
D) 150

Please explain your answer.

I have tried to use the formula for expected number of transmissions which is:

E(T) = (1 - p)^n / (1 - p)

where E(T) is the expected number of transmissions, n is the number of packets, and p is the probability of packet loss.

In this case, the number of packets is 200, and the probability of packet loss is 0.2.

So, E(T) = (1 - 0.2)^200 / (1 - 0.2)

I am getting the answer as 225.

Please let me know if my answer is correct or not.

Prompt 4:
Answer the question: Assume that Source S and Destination D are connected through an intermediate router R. How many times a packet has to visit the network layer and data link layer during a transmission from S to D?

A) Network layer – 4 times, Data link layer – 4 times
B) Network layer – 4 times, Data link layer – 6 times
C) Network layer – 2 times, Data link layer – 4 times
D) Network layer – 3 times, Data link layer – 4 times

Prompt 5:
Answer the question: Two computers C1 and C2 are configured as follows. C1 has IP address 203.197.2.53 and netmask 255.255.128.0. C2 has IP address 203.197.75.201 and netmask 255.255.192.0. Which one of the following statements is true?

A) C1 and C2 both assume they are on the same network
B) C2 assumes C1 is on same network, but C1 assumes C2 is on a different network
C) C1 assumes C2 is on same network, but C2 assumes C1 is on a different network
D) C1 and C2 both assume they are on different networks

Please provide detailed explanation for your answer.

I understand that the question is asking about the network configuration of two computers, C1 and C2, and their assumptions about their network connections. Based on the given information, I will answer the question as follows:

D) C1 and C2 both assume they are on different networks.

Explanation:

From the given information, we can see that C1 has IP address 203.197.2.53 and netmask 255.255.128.0, while C2 has IP address 203.197.75.201 and netmask 255.255.192.0.

A netmask of 255.255.128.0 on C1 indicates that it is configured for a class C network, while a netmask of 255.255.192.0 on C2 indicates that it is configured for a class B network. This means that C1 and C2 are not on the same network, as class C and class B networks have different network addresses and are not directly accessible to each other.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) C1 and C2 both assume they are on different networks.

Prompt 6:
Answer the question: Station A needs to send a message consisting of 9 packets to Station B using a sliding window (window size 3) and go-back-n error control strategy. All packets are ready and immediately available for transmission. If every 5th packet that A transmits gets lost (but no ACKs from B ever get lost), then what is the number of packets that A will transmit for sending the message to B?

A) 12
B) 14
C) 16
D) 18

Note: Please assume that the maximum size of a packet is 1000 bytes.

Answer: C) 16

Explanation:

Since we are using a sliding window (window size 3) and a go-back-n error control strategy, Station A will send 3 packets at a time (i.e., a window) and then wait for an ACK from Station B before sending the next window.

If every 5th packet that A transmits gets lost (but no ACKs from B ever get lost), then the lost packets will be replaced by the next available packets in the window. Since the window size is 3, this means that every 5th packet will be replaced by the next available packet.

Therefore, the number of packets that A will transmit for sending the message to B will be:

3 (initial window) + 3 (next window) + 3 (next window) + 3 (next window) + 3 (next window) + 3 (next window) = 16

So, the correct answer is C) 16.

Prompt 7:
Answer the question: Station A uses 32 byte packets to transmit messages to Station B using a sliding window protocol. The round trip delay between A and B is 80 milliseconds and the bottleneck bandwidth on the path between A and B is 128 kbps. What is the optimal window size that A should use?

A) 20
B) 40
C) 160
D) 320

Correct answer: C) 160

Explanation:

The optimal window size is the size that maximizes the throughput of the communication while avoiding packet loss due to buffer overflow.

We can calculate the optimal window size using the following formula:

Optimal window size = (Bandwidth x RTT) / (2 x Packet size)

where:

* Bandwidth is the bottleneck bandwidth on the path between A and B, which is 128 kbps in this case.
* RTT is the round trip delay between A and B, which is 80 milliseconds in this case.
* Packet size is the size of the packets used by A to transmit messages to B, which is 32 bytes in this case.

Substituting the values, we get:

Optimal window size = (128 x 10^3) x (80 x 10^-3) / (2 x 32)
= 160

Therefore, the optimal window size that A should use is 160 packets.

The correct answer is C) 160.

Prompt 8:
Answer the question: Using public key cryptography, X adds a digital signature σ to a message M, encrypts (M, σ) and sends it to Y, where it is decrypted. Which one of the following sequence of keys is used for operations?

A) Encryption: X’s private key followed by Y’s private key. Decryption: X’s public key followed by Y’s public key.
B) Encryption: X’s private key followed by Y’s public key. Decryption: X’s public key followed by Y’s private key.
C) Encryption: X’s private key followed by Y’s public key. Decryption: Y’s private key followed by X’s public key.
D) Encryption: X’s public key followed by Y’s private key. Decryption: Y’s public key followed by X’s private key.

Please help me understand the correct answer.

Public key cryptography uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, and the private key is used for decryption. In the question, X has a private key and a public key, and Y has a private key and a public key.

Here is the sequence of keys used for operations:

1. Encryption: X uses their private key to encrypt the message M and the digital signature σ. This gives us (M, σ) encrypted by X's private key.
2. X sends (M, σ) to Y.
3. Y uses their private key to decrypt (M, σ). This gives us M decrypted by Y's private key.
4. Y uses their public key to verify the digital signature σ. This verifies that the message M was indeed sent by X and that the digital signature is authentic.

So, the correct answer is:

B) Encryption: X’s private key followed by Y’s public key. Decryption: X’s public key followed by Y’s private key.

Explanation:

* Encryption: X uses their private key to encrypt (M, σ), so the encryption sequence is X's private key followed by Y's public key.
* Decryption: Y uses their private key to decrypt (M, σ), so the decryption sequence is X's public key followed by Y's private key.

Prompt 9:
Answer the question: The address of a class B host is to be split into subnets with a 6-bit subnet number. What is the maximum number of subnets and the maximum number of hosts in each subnet?

A) 62 subnets and 262142 hosts
B) 64 subnets and 262142 hosts
C) 64 subnets and 1024 hosts
D) 62 subnets and 1022 hosts

Answer: C) 64 subnets and 1024 hosts

Explanation:

A class B address has 6 bits for the subnet number, which allows for 2^6 = 64 possible subnets. Each subnet can have up to 2^16 - 2 = 2^14 = 16384 hosts (2^16 - 2 because the first two addresses of each subnet are reserved for the subnet broadcast address and the network address).

Therefore, the maximum number of subnets is 64, and the maximum number of hosts in each subnet is 16384.

Option C is the correct answer. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not meet the requirements of the problem.

Prompt 10:
Answer the question: The bandwidth of the line is 1.5 Mbps with round trip time (RTT) as 45 milliseconds. If the size of each packet is 1 KB (kilobytes), then what is the efficiency in Stop and Wait protocol?

A) 20.3
B) 10.0
C) 12
D) 10.8

Answer: C) 12

Explanation:

The efficiency of Stop and Wait protocol can be calculated using the following formula:

Efficiency = (Packets transmitted / Packets sent) x (1 - RTT/RTT + 2RTT)

where RTT is the round trip time, which is 45 milliseconds in this case.

First, we need to calculate the number of packets transmitted:

Packets transmitted = (Total data size / Packet size)

Total data size = 1.5 Mbps x 8 (since 1 byte = 8 bits) = 12,000,000 bits

Packet size = 1 KB = 1,000 bytes

Therefore, Packets transmitted = 12,000,000 bits / 1,000 bytes = 12,000 packets

Now, we can calculate the number of packets sent:

Packets sent = Total data size / Packet size

Packets sent = 12,000,000 bits / 1,000 bytes = 12,000 packets

Now, we can calculate the efficiency:

Efficiency = (Packets transmitted / Packets sent) x (1 - RTT/RTT + 2RTT)

Efficiency = (12,000 / 12,000) x (1 - 45/45 + 2 x 45)

Efficiency = 1 x (1 - 1 + 2)

Efficiency = 1 x 2

Efficiency = 2

Therefore, the efficiency of Stop and Wait protocol in this case is 2. The correct answer is C) 12.

Prompt 11:
Answer the question: A 1 km long broadcast LAN has bandwidth (BW) of 10⁷ bps and uses CSMA/CD, then what is the minimum size of the packet?
Given: velocity (v) = 2 × 10⁸ m/sec

A) 200 bits
B) 10
C) 50
D) 100

Answer: B

Explanation:

The bandwidth of the LAN (BW) is given as 10⁷ bps, which means that the maximum data rate that can be transmitted is 10⁷ bits per second.

The packet size is determined by the maximum size of the data that can be transmitted in one packet, which is limited by the size of the packet header and the size of the data being transmitted.

Since the LAN uses CSMA/CD, the packet size must be small enough to allow for efficient collision detection and avoidance. This means that the packet size should be small enough to allow for a short header and a small amount of data to be transmitted in each packet.

Given that the velocity of the data is 2 × 10⁸ m/sec, the minimum size of the packet can be calculated as follows:

Minimum packet size = (BW x time) / (velocity x number of bits per packet)

where time is the time it takes for the packet to be transmitted, and number of bits per packet is the number of bits that can be transmitted in each packet.

Since the packet size is limited by the size of the header and the amount of data being transmitted, we can assume that the number of bits per packet is small, typically around 100-200 bits.

Therefore, the minimum size of the packet can be calculated as follows:

Minimum packet size = (10⁷ bps x time) / (2 × 10⁸ m/sec x 100-200 bits)

Solving for time, we get:

time = (2 × 10⁸ m/sec x 100-200 bits) / (10⁷ bps x number of packets per second)

Since the number of packets per second is typically around 10^6, we can assume that the time it takes for a packet to be transmitted is around 10^-6 seconds.

Therefore, the minimum size of the packet is:

Minimum packet size = (10⁷ bps x 10^-6 seconds) / (2 × 10⁸ m/sec x 100-200 bits)

Simplifying, we get:

Minimum packet size = 100-200 bits

The correct answer is B, 100-200 bits.

Note that the actual packet size may be larger than the minimum size due to the overhead of the header and other factors, but the minimum size gives us an upper bound on the size of the packet.

Prompt 12:
Answer the question: Consider Subnet mask of class B network on the internet is 255.255.240.0. What is the maximum number of hosts per subnet?

A) 4098
B) 4096
C) 4094
D) 4092

Answer: C) 4094

Explanation:

To determine the maximum number of hosts per subnet, we need to use the formula:

2^n - 2, where n is the number of bits used for the host ID.

In this case, we have a class B network with a subnet mask of 255.255.240.0, which means we have 6 bits for the host ID.

2^6 - 2 = 2^6 = 64 - 2 = 62

Therefore, the maximum number of hosts per subnet is 62.

So, the correct answer is C) 4094.

Prompt 13:
Answer the question: Consider a token ring network with a length of 2 km having 10 stations including a monitoring station. The propagation speed of the signal is 2 × 10⁸ m/s and the token transmission time is ignored. If each station is allowed to hold the token for 2 μsec, the minimum time for which the monitoring station should wait (in μsec) before assuming that the token is lost is _______.

A) 28 to 30
B) 20 to 22
C) 0 to 2
D) 31 to 33

Solution:

The propagation speed of the signal in the token ring network is given as 2 × 10⁸ m/s.

Let's assume that the token is transmitted from station A to station B.

The distance between station A and station B is 2 km.

Time taken for the token to reach station B = Distance / Speed
= 2 km / (2 × 10⁸ m/s)
= 1 × 10^-6 s

Since each station is allowed to hold the token for 2 μsec (2 × 10^-6 s), the time for which the token is held at station B is:

Time at station B = 2 μsec

Now, let's assume that the monitoring station (station C) is located at a distance of 1 km from station A.

Time taken for the token to reach station C = Distance / Speed
= 1 km / (2 × 10⁸ m/s)
= 5 × 10^-7 s

Since the token is held at station B for 2 μsec, the time for which the token is held at station C after it reaches there is:

Time at station C = Time at station B + Time taken to reach station C
= 2 μsec + 5 × 10^-7 s
= 2 μsec + 5 × 10^-7 s

Now, we need to find the minimum time for which the monitoring station should wait before assuming that the token is lost.

Let's assume that the token is lost after it reaches station C.

Time taken for the token to reach station C = 5 × 10^-7 s

Time for which the token is held at station C before it is lost = Minimum time for which the monitoring station should wait

We can set up the following equation:

Minimum time for which the monitoring station should wait = Time taken for the token to reach station C + Time for which the token is held at station C before it is lost

Substituting the values, we get:

Minimum time for which the monitoring station should wait = 5 × 10^-7 s + 2 μsec

Simplifying, we get:

Minimum time for which the monitoring station should wait = 7 × 10^-7 s

Therefore, the minimum time for which the monitoring station should wait before assuming that the token is lost is 7 × 10^-7 s.

The correct answer is A) 28 to 30.

Prompt 14:
Answer the question: A sender is employing public key cryptography to send a secret message to a receiver. Which one of the following statements is TRUE?

A) Sender encrypts using receiver’s public key
B) Sender encrypts using his own public key
C) Receiver decrypts using sender’s public key
D) Receiver decrypts using his own public key

Answer: A) Sender encrypts using receiver’s public key

Explanation: In public key cryptography, the sender uses the receiver’s public key to encrypt the message, and the receiver uses his own private key to decrypt the message. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Prompt 15:
Answer the question: The total number of keys required for a set of n individuals to be able to communicate with each other using secret key and public key crypto-systems, respectively are:

A) n(n − 1) and 2n
B) 2n and (n(n − 1))/2
C) (n(n − 1))/2 and 2n
D) (n(n − 1))/2 and n

Please help me with this question.

Answer: C

The correct answer is C.

Explanation:

For a set of n individuals to be able to communicate with each other using secret key cryptography, each individual needs a unique secret key to decrypt the messages received from other individuals. Therefore, the total number of secret keys required is n(n-1), as each individual needs to have a secret key with every other individual in the set.

For public key cryptography, each individual needs to have a public key that can be used by others to encrypt messages, and a corresponding private key that can be used to decrypt the messages. Therefore, the total number of public keys required is 2n, as each individual needs two keys (one public and one private).

Therefore, the correct answer is C, (n(n-1)/2 and 2n).

Prompt 16:
Answer the question: An attacker sits between the sender and receiver and captures the information and retransmits to the receiver after some time without altering the information. This attack is called as _____.

A) Denial of service attack
B) Masquarade attack
C) Simple attack
D) Complex attack

Answer: B) Masquerade attack

Explanation:

In a masquerade attack, the attacker sits between the sender and receiver and captures the information being transmitted. The attacker then retransmits the information to the receiver after some time, without altering the information. This can be done to gain unauthorized access to the information being transmitted, or to disrupt the communication between the sender and receiver.

A denial of service attack is an attempt to make a computer or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic.

A simple attack is a basic type of attack that is easy to execute and does not require a lot of resources.

A complex attack is a sophisticated and highly coordinated attack that requires a lot of resources and expertise to execute.

Prompt 17:
Answer the question: In a network of LANs connected by bridges, packets are sent from one LAN to another through intermediate bridges. Since more than one path may exist between two LANs, packets may have to be routed through multiple bridges. Why is the spanning tree algorithm used for bridge-routing?

A) For shortest path routing between LANs
B) For avoiding loops in the routing paths
C) For fault tolerance
D) For minimizing collisions

Correct answer: B) For avoiding loops in the routing paths

Explanation: The spanning tree algorithm is used for bridge-routing to avoid loops in the routing paths. In a network of LANs connected by bridges, packets may have to be routed through multiple bridges to reach their destination. Without the spanning tree algorithm, loops could occur in the routing paths, causing packets to be sent in circles and never reach their destination. The spanning tree algorithm ensures that only one path exists between any two nodes in the network, avoiding loops and ensuring that packets are delivered to their destination in the shortest possible time.

Option A is incorrect because the spanning tree algorithm does not guarantee shortest path routing between LANs.

Option C is incorrect because the spanning tree algorithm does not provide fault tolerance.

Option D is incorrect because the spanning tree algorithm does not minimize collisions.

Prompt 18:
Answer the question: What is the maximum size of data that the application layer can pass on to the TCP layer below?

A) Any size
B) 2¹⁶ bytes – size of TCP header
C) 2¹⁶ bytes
D) 1500 bytes

Answer: C) 2¹⁶ bytes

Explanation:
The application layer can pass on data of any size to the TCP layer below, as there is no fixed maximum size limit imposed by the TCP protocol. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Note that the size of the TCP header itself is limited to 20 bytes, which is a relatively small portion of the overall data size. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

Option D is also incorrect, as 1500 bytes is the maximum size of an IP packet, not the maximum size of data that can be passed on to the TCP layer.

Prompt 19:
Answer the question: A client process P needs to make a TCP connection to a server process S. Consider the following situation: the server process S executes a socket(), a bind() and a listen() system call in that order, following which it is preempted. Subsequently, the client process P executes a socket() system call followed by connect() system call to connect to the server process S. The server process has not executed any accept() system call. Which one of the following events could take place?

A) connect() system call returns successfully
B) connect() system call blocks
C) connect() system call returns an error
D) connect() system call results in a core dump

Answer: B) connect() system call blocks.

Explanation:

When the client process P executes the connect() system call, it will block until the server process S executes the accept() system call to accept the connection. Since the server process S has not executed the accept() system call yet, the connect() system call will block. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Prompt 20:
Answer the question: A computer on a 10 Mbps network is regulated by a token bucket. The token bucket is filled at a rate of 2 Mbps. It is initially filled to capacity with 16 Megabits. What is the maximum duration for which the computer can transmit at the full 10 Mbps?

A) 1.6 seconds
B) 2 seconds
C) 5 seconds
D) 8 seconds

Answer: C) 5 seconds

Explanation:

The token bucket is filled at a rate of 2 Mbps, so it takes 16/2 = 8 seconds to fill the bucket to capacity.

Since the bucket is initially filled to capacity with 16 Megabits, the computer can transmit at the full 10 Mbps for 8 seconds before the bucket is empty.

Therefore, the maximum duration for which the computer can transmit at the full 10 Mbps is 8 seconds, which is option C.

Prompt 21:
Answer the question: In the slow start phase of the TCP congestion control algorithm, the size of the congestion window

A) does not increase
B) increases linearly
C) increases quadratically
D) increases exponentially

Correct answer: B) increases linearly

Explanation: In the slow start phase of the TCP congestion control algorithm, the size of the congestion window increases linearly with the increase in the number of acknowledged packets. This allows the connection to quickly ramp up to its full capacity, while avoiding the risk of overwhelming the receiver with too much data too quickly. Once the slow start phase is over, the congestion window size is adjusted based on the amount of outstanding data and the available bandwidth, as determined by the TCP algorithm.

Prompt 22:
Answer the question: In a packet switching network, packets are routed from source to destination along a single path having two intermediate nodes. If the message size is 24 bytes and each packet contains a header of 3 bytes, then the optimum packet size is:

A) 4
B) 6
C) 7
D) 9

Answer: C) 7

Explanation:

In a packet switching network, packets are routed from source to destination along a single path having two intermediate nodes. If the message size is 24 bytes and each packet contains a header of 3 bytes, then the optimum packet size is the size that minimizes the overhead of headers and packets.

To calculate the optimum packet size, we need to find the maximum value of x such that 3x + 24 is a multiple of 4.

We can solve this problem by using the Euclidean algorithm:

3x + 24 = 4(3x + 6)

Therefore, the optimum packet size is 7 bytes (3x + 6 = 7).

So, the correct answer is C) 7.

Prompt 23:

C) OEWPNRCTTUEKMRO
D) UEKPNRMROOEWCTT

What is the original message "COMPUTERNETWORK"?

Hint: The key "LAYER" has 5 letters.

Answer:

The key "LAYER" has 5 letters, so the columnar transposition cipher will have 5 columns. Let's break down the encrypted message:

CTTOEWMROPNRUEK

First column: CTTO
Second column: EWMRO
Third column: PNRUE
Fourth column: K

Now, we need to rearrange the letters in each column to spell out the original message.

First column: COMPUTER
Second column: NETWORK
Third column: RK

The original message "COMPUTERNETWORK" is spelled out in the encrypted message CTTOEWMROPNRUEK.

Therefore, the answer is:

A) CTTOEWMROPNRUEK

Prompt 24:
Answer the question: The CPU of a system having 1 MIPS execution rate needs 4 machine cycles on average for executing an instruction. Fifty percent of the cycles use the memory bus. A memory read/write employs one machine cycle. For execution of the programs, the system utilizes 90 percent of the CPU time. For block data transfer, an I/O device is attached to the system while the CPU executes the background programs continuously. What is the maximum I/O data transfer rate if programmed I/O data transfer technique is used?

A) 500 Kbytes/sec
B) 2.2 Mbytes/sec
C) 125 Kbytes/sec
D) 250 Kbytes/sec

Solution:

The CPU of the system has a MIPS execution rate of 1 MIPS, which means it can execute one million instructions per second. Since the CPU takes, on average, 4 machine cycles to execute an instruction, the CPU utilization can be calculated as follows:

CPU Utilization = (Number of Instructions Executed per Second) / (Number of Machine Cycles per Instruction)
= (1,000,000) / (4)
= 250,000 cycles/second

Since the CPU utilization is 90%, the system utilizes 90% of the CPU cycles for executing programs, which means that 90% of the 250,000 cycles/second are used for program execution.

Number of cycles used for program execution = 90% of 250,000 cycles/second
= 225,000 cycles/second

Now, we need to calculate the maximum I/O data transfer rate. We know that 50% of the CPU cycles are used for memory access, which means that 50% of the 225,000 cycles/second are used for memory access.

Number of cycles used for memory access = 50% of 225,000 cycles/second
= 112,500 cycles/second

Since a memory read/write employs one machine cycle, the maximum I/O data transfer rate can be calculated as follows:

Maximum I/O Data Transfer Rate = (Number of Memory Accesses per Second) x (Size of Memory Access)
= (112,500 cycles/second) x (1 byte)
= 112,500 bytes/second

Therefore, the maximum I/O data transfer rate is 112,500 bytes/second.

The correct answer is:

B) 2.2 Mbytes/sec.

Note: 1 byte = 8 bits, so 1 byte = 8 bits/byte. Therefore, 112,500 bytes/second = 2.2 Mbytes/second.

Prompt 25:
Answer the question: An Internet Service Provider (ISP) has the following chunk of CIDR-based IP addresses available with it: 245.248.128.0/20. The ISP wants to give half of this chunk of addresses to Organization A, and a quarter to Organization B while retaining the remaining with itself. Which of the following is a valid allocation of addresses to A and B? [GATE CSE 2012]

A) 245.248.136.0/21 and 245.248.128.0/22
B) 245.248.128.0/21 and 245.248.128.0/22
C) 245.248.132.0/22 and 245.248.132.0/21
D) 245.248.136.0/22 and 245.248.132.0/21

Explanation:

To allocate the addresses to A and B, we need to divide the available address space into two parts such that one part is half of the total address space and the other part is a quarter of the total address space.

Since the available address space is 245.248.128.0/20, half of it is 245.248.128.0/10, and a quarter of it is 245.248.128.0/5.

Therefore, a valid allocation of addresses to A and B is:

A) 245.248.136.0/21 and 245.248.128.0/22

In this allocation, Organization A gets 245.248.136.0/21, which is half of the available address space, and Organization B gets 245.248.128.0/22, which is a quarter of the available address space. The remaining addresses are retained by the ISP.

Prompt 26:
Answer the question: Consider an instance of TCP’s Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) algorithm where the window size at the start of the slow start phase is 2 MSS and the threshold at the start of the first transmission is 8 MSS. Assume that a time-out occurs during the fifth transmission. Find the congestion window size at the end of the tenth transmission.

A) 8 MSS
B) 14 MSS
C) 7 MSS
D) 12 MSS

Correct answer: B) 14 MSS

Explanation:

The AIMD algorithm works by adding the increase in the window size to the previous window size, and multiplying the decrease in the window size by a factor.

At the start of the slow start phase, the window size is 2 MSS and the threshold is 8 MSS.

During the first transmission, the sender adds the increase (2 MSS) to the previous window size (2 MSS), giving a new window size of 4 MSS.

During the second transmission, the sender adds the increase (2 MSS) to the previous window size (4 MSS), giving a new window size of 6 MSS.

During the third transmission, the sender adds the increase (2 MSS) to the previous window size (6 MSS), giving a new window size of 8 MSS.

During the fourth transmission, the sender adds the increase (2 MSS) to the previous window size (8 MSS), giving a new window size of 10 MSS.

Since a time-out occurs during the fifth transmission, the sender decreases the window size by a factor of 2, giving a new window size of 5 MSS.

During the sixth transmission, the sender adds the increase (2 MSS) to the previous window size (5 MSS), giving a new window size of 7 MSS.

During the seventh transmission, the sender adds the increase (2 MSS) to the previous window size (7 MSS), giving a new window size of 9 MSS.

During the eighth transmission, the sender adds the increase (2 MSS) to the previous window size (9 MSS), giving a new window size of 11 MSS.

During the ninth transmission, the sender adds the increase (2 MSS) to the previous window size (11 MSS), giving a new window size of 13 MSS.

Since there is no time-out during the tenth transmission, the sender does not decrease the window size. Therefore, the congestion window size at the end of the tenth transmission is 13 MSS.

The correct answer is B) 14 MSS.

Prompt 27:
Answer the question: Consider the store-and-forward packet-switched network given below. Assume that the bandwidth of each link is 10⁶ bytes/sec. A user on host A sends a file of size 10³ bytes to host B through routers R1 and R2 in three different ways. In the first case, a single packet containing the complete file is transmitted from A to B. In the second case, the file is split into 10 equal parts, and these packets are transmitted from A to B. In the third case, the file is split into 20 equal parts and these packets are sent from A to B. Each packet contains 100 bytes of header information along with the user data. Consider only transmission time and ignore processing, queuing and propagation delays. Also assume that there are no errors during transmission. Let T1, T2, and T3 be the times taken to transmit the file in the first, second, and third case respectively. Which one of the following is CORRECT?                                                                                                    A---R1---R2---B

A) T1 < T2 < T3
B) T1 > T2 > T3
C) T2 = T3, T3 < T1
D) T1 = T3, T3 > T2

My attempt:

For the first case, the file is transmitted in a single packet, so the transmission time is simply the time it takes to send 10³ bytes over the link, which is 10⁶ bytes/sec x 10³ bytes = 10³ seconds.

For the second case, the file is split into 10 equal parts, so each packet contains 10³/10 = 10² bytes of user data. The header information adds another 100 bytes to each packet. Therefore, the transmission time for each packet is 10² + 100 = 10³ bytes / 10⁶ bytes/sec = 10² seconds. Since there are 10 packets, the total transmission time is 10 x 10² = 10³ seconds.

For the third case, the file is split into 20 equal parts, so each packet contains 10³/20 = 5² bytes of user data. The header information adds another 100 bytes to each packet. Therefore, the transmission time for each packet is 5² + 100 = 5³ bytes / 10⁶ bytes/sec = 5² seconds. Since there are 20 packets, the total transmission time is 20 x 5² = 10³ seconds.

Comparing the transmission times for the three cases, we have:

T1 = 10³ seconds (single packet)
T2 = 10³ seconds (10 packets)
T3 = 10³ seconds (20 packets)

Therefore, the correct answer is:

C) T2 = T3, T3 < T1

Explanation: The transmission times for the first, second, and third cases are all equal to 10³ seconds, but the number of packets transmitted differs. In the second and third cases, the file is split into multiple packets, which increases the total transmission time. However, the increase in transmission time is not proportional to the number of packets, so the transmission time per packet decreases as the number of packets increases.

Prompt 28:
Answer the question: A and B are the only two stations on an Ethernet. Each has a steady queue of frames to send. Both A and B attempt to transmit a frame, collide, and A wins the first backoff race. At the end of this successful transmission by A, both A and B attempt to transmit and collide. The probability that A wins the second backoff race is:

A) 0.5
B) 0.625
C) 0.75
D) 1.0

Please provide a detailed explanation for your answer.

I understand that this is a classic question in computer networks, and I have tried to solve it using the basic principles of CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) protocol. However, I'm having trouble coming up with the correct answer.

Here's my thought process:

1. When both A and B attempt to transmit a frame, they collide, and A wins the first backoff race. This means that A's frame is successfully transmitted, and B has to back off for a random period of time before attempting to transmit again.
2. After A's transmission, both A and B attempt to transmit again. Since they both have the same priority, they collide again.
3. In the second backoff race, the probability of A winning is the same as the probability of B winning, since both stations have the same priority and the same amount of backoff time.

Based on this reasoning, I believe the correct answer is (B) 0.625. This is because the probability of A winning the second backoff race is the same as the probability of B winning, which is 0.5. However, since both stations have the same priority, the probability of either station winning is 0.5, which leads to the final answer of 0.625.

I would appreciate any feedback or guidance on my thought process and answer. Thank you!

Prompt 29:
Answer the question: Host A is sending data to host B over a full duplex link. A and B are using the sliding window protocol for flow control. The send and receive window sizes are 5 packets each. Data packets (sent only from A to B) are all 1000 bytes long and the transmission time for such a packet is 50 μs. Acknowledgement packets (sent only from B to A) are very small and require negligible transmission time. The propagation delay over the link is 200 μs. What is the maximum achievable throughput in this communication?

A) 7.69 × 10⁶ bytes per second
B) 11.11 × 10⁶ bytes per second
C) 12.33 × 10⁶ bytes per second
D) 15.00 × 10⁶ bytes per second

Correct answer: C) 12.33 × 10⁶ bytes per second

Explanation:

The maximum achievable throughput in this communication can be calculated using the sliding window protocol formula:

Throughput = (Window size x RTT x Packet size) / (2 x Sending rate)

where:

* Window size is the size of the sliding window, which is 5 packets in this case.
* RTT is the round-trip time, which is the propagation delay (200 μs) plus the transmission time (50 μs) for one packet, which gives a total of 250 μs.
* Packet size is the size of the data packets, which is 1000 bytes in this case.
* Sending rate is the rate at which packets are sent, which is the reciprocal of the RTT.

Substituting the values, we get:

Throughput = (5 x 250 x 1000) / (2 x 1/250)

Throughput = 12.33 x 10⁶ bytes per second

Therefore, the correct answer is C) 12.33 x 10⁶ bytes per second.

Prompt 30:
Answer the question: Consider a LAN with four nodes S1, S2, S3, and S4. Time is divided into fixed-size slots, and a node can begin its transmission only at the beginning of a slot. A collision is said to have occurred if more than one node transmits in the same slot. The probabilities of generation of a frame in a time slot by S1, S2, S3, and S4 are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 respectively. The probability of sending a frame in the first slot without any collision by any of these four stations is _________.

A) 0.462
B) 0.711
C) 0.5
D) 0.652

Solution:
The probability that no collision occurs in the first slot is the probability that no node transmits in the first slot, which is:

P(no collision) = (1 - 0.1) × (1 - 0.2) × (1 - 0.3) × (1 - 0.4) = 0.781

So, the probability of sending a frame in the first slot without any collision by any of the four stations is:

P(first slot) = P(no collision) × P(S1 transmits in first slot) + P(no collision) × P(S2 transmits in first slot) + P(no collision) × P(S3 transmits in first slot) + P(no collision) × P(S4 transmits in first slot)

= 0.781 × 0.1 + 0.781 × 0.2 + 0.781 × 0.3 + 0.781 × 0.4

= 0.781 × 0.1 + 0.781 × 0.2 + 0.781 × 0.3 + 0.781 × 0.4

= 0.781 × 0.4

= 0.312

Therefore, the correct answer is option (B) 0.711.

Prompt 31:
Answer the question: Suppose that the stop-and-wait protocol is used on a link with a bit rate of 64 kilobits per second and 20 milliseconds propagation delay. Assume that the transmission time for the acknowledgment and the processing time at nodes are negligible. Then the minimum frame size in bytes to achieve a link utilization of at least 50% is _________.

A) 160
B) 320
C) 640
D) 220

Answer: C) 640

Explanation:

The stop-and-wait protocol is used to transmit data over a link with a bit rate of 64 kilobits per second and a propagation delay of 20 milliseconds. To achieve a link utilization of at least 50%, the frame size must be large enough to allow for at least one acknowledgment to be sent before the next frame is transmitted.

Let's calculate the minimum frame size required to achieve a link utilization of at least 50%:

1. First, we need to calculate the maximum time it takes for one frame to be transmitted:

Time = (Frame size in bytes) / (Bit rate in bits per second x Propagation delay in seconds)

Time = (Frame size in bytes) / (64 kbps x 20 ms)

Time = (Frame size in bytes) / 1280

2. Next, we need to calculate the minimum frame size required to achieve a link utilization of at least 50%:

Frame size = (Time in seconds) x (Bit rate in bits per second)

Frame size = (1280) x (64 kbps)

Frame size = 8192

Therefore, the minimum frame size required to achieve a link utilization of at least 50% is 8192 bytes.

Option C) 640 is incorrect because 640 is not enough to achieve a link utilization of at least 50%.

Option A) 160 is incorrect because 160 is not enough to achieve a link utilization of at least 50%.

Option B) 320 is incorrect because 320 is not enough to achieve a link utilization of at least 50%.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) 640.

Prompt 32:
Answer the question: Consider a simplified time-slotted MAC protocol, where each host always has data to send and transmits with probability p = 0.2 in every slot. There is no backoff, and one frame can be transmitted in one slot. If more than one host transmits in the same slot, then the transmissions are unsuccessful due to collision. What is the maximum number of hosts which this protocol can support, if each host has to be provided a minimum throughput of 0.16 frames per time slot?

A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4

Answer: B

Explanation:

In this simplified time-slotted MAC protocol, each host always has data to send and transmits with probability p = 0.2 in every slot. Since there is no backoff, if more than one host transmits in the same slot, then the transmissions are unsuccessful due to collision.

To calculate the maximum number of hosts that this protocol can support, we need to determine the maximum throughput that can be achieved by each host. Since each host has to be provided a minimum throughput of 0.16 frames per time slot, we can calculate the maximum throughput as follows:

Maximum throughput = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84 frames per time slot

Now, we can calculate the maximum number of hosts that can be supported by using the formula for the maximum number of hosts in a shared channel:

Maximum number of hosts = (channel capacity / required throughput)

In this case, the channel capacity is the maximum throughput that can be achieved by each host, which is 0.84 frames per time slot. The required throughput for each host is 0.16 frames per time slot.

Therefore, the maximum number of hosts that can be supported by this protocol is:

Maximum number of hosts = (0.84 frames/slot / 0.16 frames/slot) = 5

However, since we are looking for the maximum number of hosts that can be supported with a minimum throughput of 0.16 frames per time slot, we need to round up to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the maximum number of hosts that can be supported by this protocol is:

Maximum number of hosts = 5 + 1 = 6

So, the correct answer is B.

Prompt 33:
Answer the question: Consider the following message M = 1010001101. The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for this message using the divisor polynomial x⁵ + x⁴ + x² + 1 is :

A) 01110
B) 01011
C) 10101
D) 10110

Please explain your answer.

The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-correcting code that is commonly used in digital communication systems to detect errors in transmitted data. The CRC is calculated using a divisor polynomial and the transmitted message. The divisor polynomial is a polynomial that is used to divide the message, and the remainder of the division is the CRC.

To calculate the CRC for the message M = 1010001101, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Divide the message M by the divisor polynomial x⁵ + x⁴ + x² + 1.
2. Take the remainder of the division.

Step 1: Divide the message M by the divisor polynomial x⁵ + x⁴ + x² + 1.

M = 1010001101

x⁵ + x⁴ + x² + 1 = x⁵ + 2x⁴ + 3x² + 1

M = 1010001101

= 1010001101

Step 2: Take the remainder of the division.

Remainder = 01110

Therefore, the CRC for the message M = 1010001101 is 01110.

The correct answer is A) 01110.

The other options are not the correct CRC for the message M = 1010001101:

B) 01011 is not the correct CRC for the message M = 1010001101.

C) 10101 is not the correct CRC for the message M = 1010001101.

D) 10110 is not the correct CRC for the message M = 1010001101.

Prompt 34:
Answer the question: A sender uses the Stop-and-Wait ARQ protocol for reliable transmission of frames. Frames are of size 1000 bytes and the transmission rate at the sender is 80 Kbps (1 Kbps = 1000 bits/second). The size of an acknowledgement is 100 bytes and the transmission rate at the receiver is 8 Kbps. The one-way propagation delay is 100 milliseconds.

Assuming no frame is lost, the sender throughput is __________ bytes/second.

A) 2500
B) 2000
C) 1500
D) 500

Please explain how you arrived at your answer.

Answer: C) 1500

Explanation:

The sender throughput is the amount of data sent by the sender per second. To calculate the sender throughput, we need to subtract the size of the acknowledgement from the size of each frame and divide the result by the transmission rate at the sender.

Size of each frame = 1000 bytes
Size of acknowledgement = 100 bytes

Total size of each frame = 1000 bytes - 100 bytes = 900 bytes

Transmission rate at sender = 80 Kbps

Sender throughput = (900 bytes - 100 bytes) / 80 Kbps = 1500 bytes/second

Therefore, the correct answer is C) 1500.

Prompt 35:
Answer the question: A firewall is to be configured to allow hosts in a private network to freely open TCP connections and send packets on open connections. However, it will only allow external hosts to send packets on existing open TCP connections or connections that are being opened (by internal hosts) but not allow them to open TCP connections to hosts in the private network. To achieve this, the minimum capability of the firewall should be that of:

A) A combinational circuit
B) A finite automaton
C) A pushdown automaton with one stack
D) A pushdown automaton with two stacks

Please explain your answer.

I believe the answer is D) A pushdown automaton with two stacks.

A combinational circuit (A) cannot make decisions based on the state of the system and cannot maintain any state information. It can only perform a predefined set of operations based on the current input.

A finite automaton (B) can recognize a finite set of strings, but it cannot maintain any state information. It can only be in one of the predefined states.

A pushdown automaton with one stack (C) can recognize a context-free language, but it cannot differentiate between incoming and outgoing packets. It cannot maintain any state information about the external hosts.

A pushdown automaton with two stacks (D) can recognize a context-free language and can maintain state information about the external hosts. It can differentiate between incoming and outgoing packets based on the two stacks. One stack can be used to keep track of the open connections from external hosts, and the other stack can be used to keep track of the open connections to external hosts. This allows the firewall to only allow external hosts to send packets on existing open connections or connections that are being opened by internal hosts.

Prompt 36:
Answer the question: In a network virtualization environment using NFV (Network Functions Virtualization) and SDN (Software-Defined Networking), a newly deployed intrusion detection engine inspects encapsulated traffic (VXLAN, GRE) at scale. Which challenge is most likely to degrade the engine’s effectiveness?

A) The engine’s inability to parse IPv6 extension headers
B) Excessive VLAN tag rewriting at the hypervisor layer
C) Frequent changes in the encapsulation header fields that obfuscate payload inspection
D) Strict rate limiting on the control plane traffic between SDN controller and NFV orchestrator

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:
In a network virtualization environment using NFV and SDN, encapsulated traffic (VXLAN, GRE) is common. The challenge most likely to degrade the intrusion detection engine's effectiveness is frequent changes in the encapsulation header fields that obfuscate payload inspection.

Option A is incorrect because IPv6 extension headers are not typically used in VXLAN or GRE encapsulation.

Option B is incorrect because VLAN tag rewriting at the hypervisor layer is a common practice to virtualize network resources, but it does not directly affect the intrusion detection engine's effectiveness.

Option D is incorrect because strict rate limiting on the control plane traffic between SDN controller and NFV orchestrator may affect the overall network performance, but it is not directly related to the intrusion detection engine's effectiveness.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Frequent changes in the encapsulation header fields that obfuscate payload inspection can make it challenging for the intrusion detection engine to effectively inspect the traffic and detect potential threats.

Prompt 38:
Answer the question: A novel cryptographic protocol for end-to-end security is proposed, combining elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange with advanced homomorphic encryption for data payloads. Which bottleneck is most critical to address for practical real-time communication?

A) The ephemeral key generation time for elliptic-curve keys
B) The complexity of group operations in the homomorphic domain leading to high computational overhead
C) The upper bound on the public key size for elliptic-curve systems
D) The necessity to store session keys indefinitely to maintain homomorphism

Correct answer: B) The complexity of group operations in the homomorphic domain leading to high computational overhead.

Explanation:

The proposed cryptographic protocol combines elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange with advanced homomorphic encryption for data payloads. While the ECDH key exchange provides strong end-to-end security, the homomorphic encryption for data payloads introduces computational overhead due to the complexity of group operations in the homomorphic domain.

Option B is the correct answer because the computational overhead of group operations in the homomorphic domain is the most critical bottleneck for practical real-time communication. The other options are not as critical:

A) The ephemeral key generation time for elliptic-curve keys: While the key generation time is important, it is not the most critical bottleneck for practical real-time communication.

C) The upper bound on the public key size for elliptic-curve systems: The public key size is a concern, but it is not the most critical bottleneck for practical real-time communication.

D) The necessity to store session keys indefinitely to maintain homomorphism: This is not a bottleneck for practical real-time communication, as the session keys can be stored temporarily and discarded after use.

Therefore, option B is the most critical bottleneck to address for practical real-time communication in the proposed cryptographic protocol.

Prompt 39:
Answer the question: If you want to connect your home computer so that you can view your school's website, in addition to your computer and modem you will need

A) DSL, a browser, and the correct protocols
B) An ISDN line, Windows, and an ISP
C) Both an ISDN and DSL line and a browser
D) An ISP, browser, and your school's URL

Correct answer: C) Both an ISDN and DSL line and a browser

Explanation:

To connect your home computer to the internet so that you can view your school's website, you will need both an ISDN and DSL line. This is because ISDN is a type of dial-up internet connection that is not fast enough to support viewing multimedia content like videos and images, while DSL is a type of high-speed internet connection that can support such content. Additionally, you will need a browser to view the website.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) Both an ISDN and DSL line and a browser.

Prompt 40:
Answer the question: Host A sends a UDP datagram containing 8880 bytes of user data to host B over an Ethernet LAN. Ethernet frames may carry data up to 1500 bytes (i.e., MTU = 1500 bytes). The size of the UDP header is 8 bytes and the size of the IP header is 20 bytes. There is no option field in the IP header. How many total number of IP fragments will be transmitted and what will be the contents of the offset field in the last fragment?

A) 6 and 925
B) 6 and 7400
C) 7 and 1110
D) 7 and 8880

Answer: C

Explanation:

1. The total size of the UDP datagram is 8880 bytes.
2. The MTU of the Ethernet LAN is 1500 bytes.
3. The size of the IP header is 20 bytes.
4. The size of the UDP header is 8 bytes.

To calculate the number of IP fragments, we need to subtract the size of the headers (28 bytes) from the total size of the datagram (8880 bytes):

8880 - 28 = 8852 bytes

Since the datagram size is not a multiple of the MTU, it will be fragmented into multiple packets. The last fragment will have a size of:

8852 - 1500 = 7352 bytes

The offset field in the last fragment will contain the size of the last fragment, which is:

7352 - 28 = 7324 bytes

Therefore, the total number of IP fragments will be 7, and the contents of the offset field in the last fragment will be 7324.

Prompt 41:
Answer the question: A serial transmission T₁ uses 8 information bits, 2 start bits, 1 stop bit, and 1 parity bit for each character. A synchronous transmission T₂ uses 3 eight-bit sync characters followed by 30 eight-bit information characters. If the bit rate is 1200 bits/second in both cases, what are the transfer rates of T₁ and T₂?

A) 100 characters/sec, 153 characters/sec
B) 80 characters/sec, 136 characters/sec
C) 100 characters/sec, 136 characters/sec
D) 80 characters/sec, 153 characters/sec

Answer: C) 100 characters/sec, 136 characters/sec

Explanation:

T₁:

* 8 information bits + 2 start bits + 1 stop bit + 1 parity bit = 12 bits/character
* 1200 bits/second / 12 bits/character = 100 characters/second

T₂:

* 3 sync characters + 30 information characters = 33 characters/second
* 1200 bits/second / 33 characters/second = 136 characters/second

Therefore, the transfer rates of T₁ and T₂ are 100 characters/second and 136 characters/second, respectively.

Prompt 42:
Answer the question: What will be the total minimum bandwidth of the channel required for 7 channels of 400 kHz bandwidth multiplexed together with each guard band of 20 kHz?

A) 2800 kHz
B) 2600 kHz
C) 3600 kHz
D) 2920 kHz

Answer: C) 3600 kHz

Explanation:

The total minimum bandwidth of the channel required for 7 channels of 400 kHz bandwidth multiplexed together with each guard band of 20 kHz can be calculated as follows:

7 x 400 kHz = 2800 kHz (total bandwidth of 7 channels)

Plus, for each guard band of 20 kHz:

20 kHz x 7 = 140 kHz (total guard band width)

Therefore, the total minimum bandwidth of the channel required for 7 channels of 400 kHz bandwidth multiplexed together with each guard band of 20 kHz is:

2800 kHz + 140 kHz = 3600 kHz

So, the correct answer is C) 3600 kHz.

Prompt 43:
Answer the question: In a web server, ten WebPages are stored with the URLs of the form http://www.yourname.com/var.html, where var is a different number from 1 to 10 for each Webpage. Suppose, the client stores the Webpage with var = 1 (say W1) in the local machine, edits and then tests. The rest of the WebPages remain on the web server. W1 contains several relative URLs of the form “var.html” referring to the other WebPages. Which one of the following statements needs to be added in W1, so that all the relative URLs in W1 refer to the appropriate WebPages on the web server?

A) <a.href: "http://www.yourname.com/", href: "...var.html">
B) <base href="http://www.yourname.com/">
C) <a.href: "http://www.yourname.com/">
D) <base href="http://www.yourname.com/", range: "...var.html">

Please explain the answer.

Answer: B

Explanation:

When a Webpage is loaded from a local machine, the relative URLs in the Webpage will resolve to the local machine's file system. To make the relative URLs in W1 refer to the appropriate WebPages on the web server, we need to specify the base URL of the web server in W1.

Option B does this by setting the base URL of the web server as the base href of W1. This tells the browser to resolve all relative URLs in W1 relative to the base URL of the web server, instead of the local machine's file system.

Option A sets the href attribute of an anchor tag to "http://www.yourname.com/", which is the URL of the web server, but it does not set the base URL of the web server. Therefore, this option will not work.

Option C sets the base URL of the web server as the href attribute of an anchor tag, but it does not set the base URL as the base href of W1. Therefore, this option will not work either.

Option D is not a valid option, as there is no such attribute as range in HTML.

Answer the question: For a host machine that uses the token bucket algorithm for congestion control, the token bucket has a capacity of 1 megabyte and the maximum output rate is 20 megabytes per second. Tokens arrive at a rate to sustain output at a rate of 10 megabytes per second. The token bucket is currently full and the machine needs to send 12 megabytes of data. The minimum time required to transmit the data is _________________ seconds.

A) 1.1
B) 0.1
C) 2.1
D) 2.0

Answer: C) 2.1

Explanation:

The token bucket algorithm is a simple congestion control mechanism that is used to regulate the output rate of a host machine. The algorithm works by maintaining a token bucket that is filled with tokens at a constant rate. The tokens are used to allow the host to send data at a maximum output rate.

In this case, the token bucket has a capacity of 1 megabyte and the maximum output rate is 20 megabytes per second. This means that the token bucket can hold a maximum of 1/20th of the maximum output rate, or 50,000 tokens.

If the token bucket is currently full, and the host needs to send 12 megabytes of data, it will take at least 2.1 seconds to transmit the data, since the host can only send data at a rate of 10 megabytes per second (the maximum output rate).

Therefore, the minimum time required to transmit the data is 12 megabytes / 10 megabytes per second = 2.1 seconds.

So, the correct answer is C) 2.1 seconds.

Answer the question: Consider a TCP connection in a state where there are no outstanding ACKs. The sender sends two segments back to back. The sequence numbers of the first and second segments are 230 and 290 respectively. The first segment was lost, but the second segment was received correctly by the receiver. Let X be the amount of data carried in the first segment (in bytes), and Y be the ACK number sent by the receiver. The values of X and Y (in that order) are

A) 60 and 290
B) 230 and 291
C) 60 and 231
D) 60 and 230

Please provide an explanation for your answer.

I'm having trouble with this question because I don't understand how the sequence numbers and the ACK numbers are related. Can someone please explain? Thank you!

Answer: D) 60 and 230

Explanation:

When the sender sends two segments back to back, the receiver will receive the second segment before it receives the first segment. Since the first segment was lost, the receiver will not have received any data for the first segment, so it will not send any ACK for it. Therefore, the ACK number sent by the receiver will be the same as the sequence number of the second segment, which is 230.

The amount of data carried in the first segment is 60 bytes, since the first segment had a sequence number of 230 and the sender sent two segments back to back. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 60 and 230.

Prompt 46:
Answer the question: Purpose of a start bit in RS-232 serial communication protocol is

A) to synchronize receiver for receiving every byte
B) to synchronize receiver for receiving a sequence of bytes
C) a parity bit
D) to synchronize receiver for receiving the last byte

Answer: B) to synchronize receiver for receiving a sequence of bytes

Explanation: The start bit is a single bit that is sent at the beginning of each byte in an RS-232 serial communication. It is used to synchronize the receiver with the sender, so that the receiver knows when a new byte is being sent. The start bit is always the first bit of a byte and is followed by 8 data bits and 1 or 2 stop bits.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B) to synchronize receiver for receiving a sequence of bytes.

Prompt 47:
Answer the question: Consider an uncompressed stereo audio signal of CD quality which is sampled at 44.1 kHz and quantized using 16 bits. What is the required storage space if a compression ratio of 0.5 is achieved for 10 seconds of this audio?

A) 172 KB
B) 430 KB
C) 860 KB
D) 1720 KB

Hint: Calculate the required storage space for one second of audio first.

Solution:

To calculate the required storage space for one second of audio, we need to consider the following factors:

1. Sampling rate: 44.1 kHz
2. Number of samples per second: 44100
3. Bit depth: 16 bits
4. Compression ratio: 0.5

From the given information, we know that the audio signal is uncompressed, so the number of samples per second is equal to the sampling rate.

1. Calculate the number of bits required for one second of audio:

Number of samples per second = 44100
Bit depth = 16

Total number of bits required for one second of audio = Number of samples per second x Bit depth
= 44100 x 16
= 691200

2. Calculate the required storage space for one second of audio:

Required storage space for one second of audio = Total number of bits required for one second of audio / Compression ratio
= 691200 / 0.5
= 1382400

Now, we need to calculate the required storage space for 10 seconds of audio:

Required storage space for 10 seconds of audio = Required storage space for one second of audio x Number of seconds
= 1382400 x 10
= 13824000

Therefore, the correct answer is:

C) 860 KB

Note that the compression ratio of 0.5 means that the compressed audio file will be half the size of the original uncompressed file.

Prompt 48:
Answer the question: If the frame buffer has 8 bits per pixel and 8 bits are allocated for each of the R, G, B components, what would be the size of the lookup table?

A) 24 bytes
B) 1024 bytes
C) 768 bytes
D) 256 bytes

Note: In this case, each pixel has 8 bits for each of the R, G, and B components, so the total number of bits in a pixel is 8 \* 8 \* 8 = 512 bits.

Therefore, the size of the lookup table would be:

512 bits / 8 bits per byte = 64 bytes.

So the correct answer is A) 24 bytes.

Answer the question: Which one of the following is used to compute cyclomatic complexity?

A) The number of regions – 1
B) E – N + 1, where E is the number of flow graph edges and N is the number of flow graph nodes
C) P – 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G
D) P + 1, where P is the number of predicate nodes in the flow graph G

Correct answer:

B) E – N + 1, where E is the number of flow graph edges and N is the number of flow graph nodes

Rationale:

Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the structural complexity of a program, which is based on the flow of control through the program. It is computed using a flow graph, which is a graphical representation of the flow of control through the program. The flow graph has nodes and edges, where each node represents a statement in the program and each edge represents a flow of control from one statement to another.

The cyclomatic complexity of a program is defined as the number of linearly independent paths through the flow graph. There are several different methods for computing the cyclomatic complexity, but one common method is to use the number of edges in the flow graph minus the number of nodes in the flow graph plus one. This method is based on the idea that each edge in the flow graph represents a flow of control from one statement to another, and each node in the flow graph represents a point of decision or a point of control transfer.

Therefore, the correct answer is B) E – N + 1, where E is the number of flow graph edges and N is the number of flow graph nodes. This formula computes the cyclomatic complexity of a program by counting the number of edges in the flow graph minus the number of nodes in the flow graph plus one.
